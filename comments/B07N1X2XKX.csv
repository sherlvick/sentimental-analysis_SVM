The highs are crisp and the mid-levels are clear, never muddled, and the bass substantial without being at all distorted by reverberation.They are simple to pair, taking any guesswork out of the process, telling you when they are powered on and powered off, and when they are paired. The case is great, it allows you to carry them both together while still enjoying a true stereo experience, and out of the case they can be separated such that they emulate theater speakers, again in true stereo.They come with everything one needs to use them including a dual split usb power cable and a/c adapter, so you can charge both of the speakers simultaneously using this single cable and an auxiliary cable so one does not have to be bluetooth ready with their input device. I highly recommend these speakers and would buy them again.",B07N1X2XKX,5,16 May 2019,/process.php?d=zrqLSKXKlnxOISC1UerKVomJUXrjWK9dGUfTeLrF2zv%2BHn9x26nxGQEjE7cYfb1CWtobW%2BrFl0Rv7vJ8X4ta%2BymB5oSTdNNUD3LPeeH%2BzJ%2FK6%2BD83tMFVzC9LXkfiNmqoNIl&b=1,Good

Highs are clear and just enough bass to give a little punch to the music. Be advised that your best sound will come after a few hours of use.Love how versatile and durable the speakers are. They are well protected and more water resistant in their rubberized case. When out of the case, I stick them on the microwave, refrigerator, or flat surface.They have a few unusual tricks. Not only can you physically separate them for wireless Bluetooth stereo, you can do the same thing with auxiliary input! Plug in the aux cable to one of the speakers and the other one will play the other channel when separated. Nice trick.On my Android phone, the speaker battery level shows up in the top status bar. These are true 2-way speakers. The woofer at the base of the speaker is active, meaning it is powered and receives low frequencies only. This makes the bass very satisfying for a small speaker. You can feel the bass on whatever surface the speakers are placed.",B07N1X2XKX,5,16 May 2019,/process.php?d=zrqLSKXKlnxOISC1UerKVomJUXrjWK9dGUfTeLrF2zv%2BHn9x26nxfx1LB9QeHMZOVt8ILrfSlB8x4MBATqZk6Cuu3b%2B%2BcNJ8JHLXKrfylPfL%2BZ7iucEfUEPCX35m97DAysE2pQ%3D%3D&b=1,Nice

UPDATE: Have purchased another set of Crossbeats Dynamite speakers.For years I've purchased many Bluetooth speakers. I was in search of that perfect speaker that could not only be loud enough to hear over my bikes engine, But have some great quality. I just found that and more! Right out of the box I was very impressed! These little guys had a decent weight, Much nicer looking than the picture, And paired easily. The sound quality, Wow! I couldn't believe the Awesome variety of sounds you get by merely moving the two cones around. Great Highs, Rockin Bass, These little guys are ready to compete with the larger expensive speakers I own. Just the sleek design, Plus the magnets make these guys perfect size easy to transport. Crossbeats Dynamite are a must have! At this price, This is a steal. I've been showing these guys off to my friends, And about to order another set for myself. I highly recommend! When I found out that owning a Samsung S9 that I could sync 4 speakers, I took advantage of it. WOW! If you think that just 2 of these amazing speakers sound great, You should hear 4!! I am more than impressed by my Crossbeats speakers. I love,love, love these speakers.
