And i must say, i go with the right product.I was searching for headphones that i can buy under 4000 as i ran out of budget and i can see many wireless headphones under 4000 on amazon but those were not really the buds wireless.Wireless and buds are two different technologies works on same medium but the trend of wire type Bluetooth headset are getting older.I love Apple ear buds but seriously i do not have such a huge budget for headphones. So luckily i found this and just to give a try i ordered it let me explain more about this product. If you like my experience then you can must opt the product.Pros:- Better Battery Life. Not much but at the worst case this leaf buds will last longer for 160 Minutes in single charge. And i think it's good.- I use these leaf buds in both of my iPhone and Android and i love voice assistant. Siri works awesome with these buds- the magnetic charger in the small box is just phenomenal- Waterproof as usual and sporty designCons:- Charger wire is very small. They should prove a long charger wire- color option should be there. I think white color will look more glossy then black.- Transmission distance should be increase from 10m to 30mVerdictWell, overall i rated full because this is perfect match for my day to day life works. The audio, deep bass is just i love it ðŸ˜�ðŸ˜�Thanks",B07QTXGP4T,5,20 May 2019,/process.php?d=zrqLSKXKlnxOISC1UerKVomJUXrjWK9dGUfTeLrF2zv%2BHn9x26nxfwZCDdsLFrpBRsAeRrfSlB8x4MBATqZk6Cuu3b%2B%2BcNJ8JHLXKrfylPfL%2BZ7iucEfUEPCX35m6NXAv8lJqQ%3D%3D&b=1,You must go for it

In the present, their are many brands who has Earbuds, Why I wished to have this earbuds was...Earbuds are typically less expensive than headphones, much lighter and far less bulky. they're quite portable, which is why I probably see people with wires hanging out of their ears every day in cafes, on the sidewalk and at work. Because earbuds only sit in your ear canals, they don't affect my hairstyle, or the wearing of glasses and earrings.Â I started using it the day a recived Delivery. What I actually noticed was the metallic look and the style of design. Placements of Leaf logo. I love the sound quality. it's so soft and Proper with high bass which I loved the most.
