0," One of the best game music soundtracks - for a game I didn't really play: Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game, the music I heard (plus the connection to Chrono Trigger which was great as well) led me to purchase the soundtrack, and it remains one of my favorite albums. There is an incredible mix of fun, epic, and emotional songs. Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like, as there's not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks. I must admit that one of the songs (Life-A Distant Promise) has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs, which I find distracting. But even if those weren't included I would still consider the collection worth it.",__label__2

8," Not an ""ultimate guide"": Firstly,I enjoyed the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader). However, I did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal. If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you.",__label__1

So, I begrudgingly clicked yes on the third try, and it installed quicktime 5, THEN it tells me to please install the quicktime available on the disc. It KEPT telling me that, even after I uninstalled my version of quicktime 7.5, and reinstalled Barbie Rapunzel and quicktime 5. Very frustrating, and the game absolutely will not work for me. It keeps telling me over and over, to install quicktime 5, tho I've been through the installation process repeatedly. It is NOT my ""operating system limitations"". This is a brand new computer...merely weeks old with all the state of the art contraptions.",__label__1 
12, TRULY MADE A DIFFERENCE!: I have been using this product for a couple years now. I started using it because my hair had gotten so dry from all the chemical treatments and relaxers. This actualy came in the relaxer kit. I tried it and could not beleive the difference it made with one use. I could not find it in any of the stores at the time so I searched Amazon and they had it. I absolutely love it. It is the best moisturizing product I have used so far. My hair is soft with good elasticity and it is not breaking anywhere close to what it was. I am very happy with it.,__label__2

15," Simple, Durable, Fun game for all ages: This is an AWESOME game! Almost everyone know tic-tac-toe so it is EASY to learn and quick to play. You can't play just once! The twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes - just big enough to gobble up your opponent. The first person to make tic-tac-toe wins, but it's not as easy as it looks when you're stuck in the mindset of just making three in a row and forget about the gobbling possibilities!

As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (70MB on dial up!), and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that).

I love Ash.The entire Night World seris is the bomb. I read mostly everyone of L.J Smiths book and they all are awesome. I think Ash and Mary Lynetee are one of the sweetest soulmates. I loved how they tried to fight there feelings but couldn't. There should be real guys like Ash,Quinn,Juliun,Damon,Gabriel and I can go on forever.

37," Book of Chance: I had just finished reading 'The Food of Love' by Anthony Capella since I had nothing to do, but read. Mind you, reading is one of my favorite pastimes.I had recently bought a series of books. The Food of Love was just one of the books I just picked up so I can get that 'three for the price of two' deal at Waterstones in London (British's equivalent of Barnes&Noble;). I wasn't really interested, but it was one of the more interesting options I had. Well, I'm glad I made the right choice! I started reading it last night and I haven't put it down since.If you love food and a little romance, which I am both fond of, it's an excellent book to read. Mr. Capella was remarkably thorough in his description of the rich and textured Italian dishes that the words assails you with a sense of smell and taste that leaves you hungry for more. This book took me by surprise and I'm sure you would not be disappointed.",__label__2 
38," Light reading, light in substance: A clichéd storyline based on the classic Cyrano de Bergerac, this book reads like a rookie novel written by someone who has a knowledge and passion for Italian culture and cuisine, but little experience in developing a story. I can understand Bruno and his passion for cooking, but have no clue as to his passion for Laura. It seems to be primarily based on her being a blonde American. How exotic. Her character is so underdeveloped- we know she's studying art history, and she enjoys Bruno's cooking with a passion. That's about it. And Tomasso, he's just the cliché for any over-sexed Mediterranean male who encounters foreign females.It's a light and entertaining read if you can get beyond all of the reasons you should put it down and walk away. That being said, I will, however, check out this author's more recent novels. He does seem to have a way with technical details, hopefully his storytelling has caught up.",__label__1

41," Real HTML for people who build sites for a living: This book is simply great! If you build sites for a living you probably struggle with books that trivialize HTML and present its syntax willy-nilly. This book is the ONLY book I've ever seen that actually seems to be written by someone who builds sites professionally and wants to know all the markup. It explains logical and physical tagging styles well and does a really good job showing how to hook HTML with other technologies without trying to teach CGI, CSS, etc. at the same time. The only thing I wish is that this guy would write a JavaScript or DHTML book. I'd buy that right away.",__label__2 
42," Marriage has its good and bad moments: This is a tear-jerker mixed with humor. A lot of rough patches for this couple but don't let that scare you off because there are also a lot of good times, too. I watch this movie often as I am a hopeless romantic and I thoroughly enjoy the music and dancing (Hindi style & Pop Rock mix), plus it's worth wading through the tears to get to the fun parts.

45," More Romance Please and Less Mystery!!: the reason i gave two stars when I usually give 5 stars for ms. feehan's books is b/c this book was tooooooo mystery/gothic genre rather than romance. I really didn't feel like the two main characters were in love, in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroine's point of view and I was getting sick of her whining and her point of view. unlike the ""dark"" series, you really didnt feel any passion. the book is better suited for the mystery/gothic genre and NOT romance.even the mystery was not that good! its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages. throughout the entire book, you're kept in suspense of who was the bad guy, if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of pages....Ms. Feehan, if your reading, please focuse more on the main characters relation to each other rather then distract us with so much unamusing mystery!",__label__1 
46," A Lost Author: I have read all of the Carpathian novels to date, except one. I very much enjoyed them at first, but nothing EVER gets resolved. You would think that after 16 books something would have been resolved and a new obstacle introduced. As for this book, it is an off-shoot of another Carpathian novel about the Jaguar Line. I was hoping to find out more about this curse, the origins and why the males kill the females. Nothing, not a word about the Jaguar curse. And why do the walls and ceilings change? Ideas introduced and left at that. Ms. Feehan went, once again, off on a tagent. Her books become less and less meaty and more and more expensive.

Her books just get better and better as you go through the Kay Scarpetta series.I really enjoy the series concept and the fact that some of the same characters keep returning from book to book. It's nice to see the characters develop through each story line. It allows you to get comfortable with them, get close to them, and get frustrated with them when they do something out of character.I highly recommend reading not just this book but the entire Kay Scarpetta series.",__label__2 
49," Best of the First Four in this series.: This is an awesome book. Kay just keeps getting better and better. It's also fun to see the characters develop more with each book - Kay herself as she seems to be always ""one against the world"", Marino who it appears is heading towards some sort of heart attack, Lucy who seems to be getting more and more quixotic. In this book Kay finds herself smack in the middle of a series of gruesome killings. It appears that a recently executed murderer, who Kay herself has seen on her autopsy table, is still around committing crimes. A number of murders occur where the executed murderer's fingerprints are turning up. Kay, Marino and Benton try to track a killer, but it appears that the corruption goes up a long ways into the political stratosphere. This is a taut and totally believable thriller.

In this edition she's made some changes. Cheap shopping is listed and the luxe, nowhere else except NYC stores are listed as well. She must have gotten some younger helpers because much to my delight the Sean Jean store and and Triple Five Soul shop are mentioned too. One thing I've always liked about the Born to Shop series is that the advice shows you how to get around town safely, how to buy quality and how to have a good time with as few hassles as possible.

If you were a fan of the other games then you will definately love this game.The graphics are better and the controls( though they'vechanged a little bit) are easy to get used to.The biggest downfall the game has is that you do not start out playing as Dante, but some new kid named Nero. However, once you start playing as Nero you'll find out just how cool he is too. In some of the gaming mags I've read the reviewers liked playing Nero more than Dante. I personally like playing Dante more, but hey, Nero is still very cool.The only other thing left to say about the game is that it's a true DMC game. The story and attitude of the characters are all there. The beautiful women and strange demons are in the game too. If you own a PS3 then buy this game. If you are getting a PS3 then get this game.

I'm hoping that if I keep washing it it will soften up. It's just one of those blankets that when you put it over someone it stays in the same shape until you bring it closer to you. At this point my son uses a different blanket when he goes to bed. One that is much softer and lays over him completely with out creating little air vents. I love the look of the set but was disapointed with the quality of it. Maybe it'll get better with washing.",__label__1

233692," Well, it's ... different.: Keeping an open mind, I was prepared to read an objective work on modern day ""cults,"" which, oddly enough, include almost every world religion. What I found was a completely biased, mean-spirited jab at every belief system that didn't smack of hard-core Christianity. No one, but the most rabid Christian, could possibly find this book interesting, enlightening, or even entertaining. It is an insult that a Baptist minister chooses to wield immaturity and prideful judgement as a weapon against others.

Have you ever wanted to know why the Seventh Day Adevtise Church is the way it is? Or have you wanted to always know how Islam, Mormons or Jehovah Witnesses got their start? Everything in Walter Martin's book is based upon hard facts found in magazines, court cases and documented sources. This book will open your eyes and make you realize the fabrications that many cults and religions have painstaikingly gone through to create the illusion of what is the truth. Walter Martin's Kingdom of the Cults opens these falsehoods to the light of day and it gives Christians the tools to have intelligent and rational discussions with a person who believes one of these ruses. It is a tantamount book, resourceful, direct and above all it is the truth.",__label__2 
233694, Kingdom of the Cults: Excellent and informative book! I was a bit surprised to see that the Seventh Day Adventists are no longer considered a cult in spite of the fact that I know they still are very much focused on the teaching of Ellen G. White.,__label__2 
233695," You , too, might be a cultist (if you're not a fundie) !: How are we supposed to tke a book seriously that lumps Islam (a major world religion that inculdes nearly 1/4 of the world's population) in with small fringe groups like the Moonies. It is simply a fact that the world ""cult"" is only appropriate when used to denote groups that are small, extremely authoritarian (i.e. centered around a strong leader with unchecked power over the members) and outside the maintream of any major tradition. A world religion is by definition not a cult. Niether is a well established liberal Protestant denomination like the Unitarian Church a cult. If any group that is not conservative Protestant is a cult (which seem to be Martin's basic premise), then why doesn't he call Judaism, Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy cults?

Very helpful for me in understanding where people I know are coming from.",__label__2 
233697," Modern mob adventure: This is really an underrated film about a group of criminals working in Los Angeles. The story involves strong loyalty among gang members, but also betrayal and greed by one of its members. Some of the scenes are raw and gripping, and the police are not always angels. Los Angeles comes alive as the focal point for this film, and it's engaging to consider the way criminals devise schemes to rob from the rich and then become emulators of the wealthy.",__label__2 
233698," Nice looking magazine rack: Overall, it's a nice looking magazine rack. It's not solid wood, as I expected - it's the type of wood you would expect to see on Target furniture. The metal hardware also broke for me (as it did in the other user's review) - but luckily I had another one on hand. Those parts just aren't very reliable. The price may be a bit high. But I was unable to find a style that I liked as much as this one. Overall, I am pleased with it and it is doing a good job holding all my magazines.",__label__2 
233699," Coast to coast fiasco: Arthur, please leave Florida to the likes of Carl Hiaasen or Elmore Leonard. Your novel failed short in its depiction of our favorite state. The cast of characters wasn't excessively long, but the individual storylines were poorly developed. All the coincidences!: the FBI agent who falls for the car-collector woman who sells her red Jaguar to the parents of the teenage bank robber who ""killed"" a senator with an asthma attack... The vicious and beautiful killer, her lovely parents, her psychic blind daughter... How forced and convoluted. I prefer simpler novels. This is not it.",__label__1

The vendor decided that Alaska did not apply and cancelled the order which was a gift for a loved one which of course did not arrive as scheduled. Clearly this could have shipped United States postal if the vendor was concerned for the customer but in this case it was cancelled after taking their time as well. I would not use any vendor other than Amazon direct. They have never pulled this on me after many many orders sent to Alaska. Beware of this vendor!!!,__label__1

233702," Just one complaint: This game has greatly improved from its previous installments. But there is one thing that continues to annoy me, that is the repetitive game play. The enemies do change quite a bit but you run into similar enemies way more often than you should in my opinion. But the graphics are great all the way around. The new styles and weapons are very fun in every way. Also the story is interesting more so than any of the previous DMC games. I would recommend this game for anyone who wants to enjoy Devil May Cry one last time at its peak. This game is worth a look.",__label__2 
233703," Don't buy this product: Many of the reviews here are accurate and valuable. The most important piece of advice is to contact Linksys and see if your printer is supported. Having set the environment up with my HP OfficeJet K60 everything seems fine. When I go to print however, the application recognizes the printer and even knows what port it is connected on. Unfortunately, everything I print goes into a black hole. After calling Linksys support, they tell me that looking through their internal list it shows a number of poor people like myself who have tried and failed to get the K60 working, so they ""assume"" its not supported.When I asked if I could get a copy of the list indicating what is supported, I was told its an internal only document. So its trial and error if you have this product.Like other reviews, they recommended that I upgrade to the WPS11 server.

I was taken by the variety and inventiveness of many of the recipes where various ingredients are combined in very clever ways in order to get not only the flavour but also the correct texture.I particularly like the recipes for raw lasagna, sushi and dolmas. These are great for surprising the non-raw with the possibilities of food in its natural state.

It really shows how ignorant the general public is about reptiles... they seem to just accept the information because it is published by a PhD.Reading this, and considering it good is like reading a children's book about a construction company, and trying to builda house with it.

233714," It does what it's supposed to: I've read some of the reviews about this product and the biggest complaint seems to be that the head sometimes gets water on the garment. I only get spots when I try and use it on something laid flat because the water condenses in the head. It will also condense in the hose and if the hose drops below the steamer it gurgles. This really is not a tabletop item, it has to be used on the floor. I've used it on just about all my cloths: khakis, polos, button-down shirts and it does a reasonably good job. If I have one complaint about it, it is that the cord is too short. and with the steamer on the floor, it will barely reach the top of an item hung using the over-the-door hook. I also wish it had a way to fill the reservoir (which is only 8 oz.) with out removing the hose.

233721, Not worth it: I got this product thinking that it would replace my iron and ironing board - I was wrong! It is not strong enough to take the wrinkles out of khaki pants or oxford shirts that are a cotton/polyester blend. The clothes do not hold their shape either. It took me longer to steam a pair of pants than it would have for me to just iron them because of how you have to tough at the pants to make the fabric straight for the steamer. I guess I was looking for an easy way out of ironing and this product was definitely not it!,__label__1

This bra is just a thin piece of material in front, which is hard to tell from just online pictures. I have wanted to return mine, but am not sure if it's too late or not.

233733, Complete Deparature from Everything Good in Resident Evil series: We were so excited to buy this game we bought it the day it came out without reading any reviews. Big mistake! We had loved all the other Resident Evil games so much that we had faith this one would also be great. You cannot even control the characters in the game and it's basically just target practice for you and your Wii controller. None of the story line is new. It's all scenes from previous games. Our favorite aspect of previous Resident Evil games is the puzzle-like quality where you need to collect things and figure out how to use them later on in the game. This game required no thinking whatsoever. Very disappointing. $50 down the drain for 15 minutes of disappointment.,__label__1

Who coiuld ever believe the Darcy's would get caught up in something like this!",__label__1 
233742," Plot was lame. Started OK but no other redeeming features.: As other reviewers describe, the language is not period (or British) and the plot is horrid. Anachronisms all over the place, especially in the newly introduced characters. The American characters and the Black Magic themes do not work at all.I agree with the reviewers who found the beginning of the book mildly intriguing, with a nice relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth. The book goes downhill from the point when the Darcys discover the newly married Caroline (Bingley) walking in the gutter in the middle of the night.The characterizations of the original P&P; characters are good, the settings and wit are mostly acceptable, but none are excellent or inspiring enough to even begin to overcome the plot deficiencies.This one a loser.

However, it is riddled with errors regarding U.S. manufacturers. For instance, it shows a photo of a Mount Horeb, Wisconsin fire truck and claims it's in Canada. The authors do not seem to know that Crown Firecoach went out of business in the '80s and Pirsch did so in the '90s. The coverage of Pierce is pathetically short given its prominence in the U.S. market. If I can find these errors about U.S. companies in just five minutes, one can only wonder how many more there for manufacturers from other countries that I have much less knowledge of.

Of course, these books are prominently displayed, as the right-wing will go into hysterics if they were not and cry ""LIBERAL CABAL!!!""The Gambler Bennett, well, he's broke even with his new manual on how to convince the world on the need to end moral decline once and for all in the United States, especially after the wretched events of 9/11. And of course, The Gambler has all the answers to our problems.

For example, gambling is legal but many find this distasteful so is gambling not a decent thing to do? T But the big fault I have with this book is that Mr. Bennett tells us that we must sacrifice but Mr. Bennett has not sacrificed by serving in the military which for me makes him appear to be an elitist.",__label__1

What these pictures do not show is it is virtually impossible to put your chosen fuel into these cans. You need at least four hands and maybe more for the larger size cans. After my first time of trying to fill my mower from the one gallon can I realized the assorted safety virtues are there for those people who have no clue. Kind of like the ones who designed the can I suppose, unless the whole idea is if you can't get fuel into the can, you are safe. People whose hands are small have a hard time with these cans, people with large hands may have it easier. I spilled nearly the entire gallon when filling my mower, back to plastic I think.

Standouts are Kirwan's Something Inside of Me and Without You and, of course, the three Peter Green classics, Love That Burns, Albatross and Black Magic Woman. As one listens to Green wail on Magic it becomes crystal clear why both BB and Eric consider him to be one of the great guitarists.Had Fleetwood Mac not morphed into a mega pop band in 1976 they would still have occupied a significant position in the history of English blues.

That opinion or the majority of it has to be accepted as the proper answer. Second there is the problem with the wrongly dated death of Herod - he died in 1 BC and not in 4 BC. Furthermore there is the Quirinius-Problem. As Jack Finegan in his Handbook of Biblical Chronology (Princeton 1964) wrote, Sulpicius Quirinius was ruling in 3 and 2 BC. This would fit with the church fathers. The astronomical question: Much closer conjunctions we had in August 12, 3 BC, in June 17, 2 BC and in August 27, 2 BC.

Her character was completely annoying, as she seemed to behave completely inconsistently and irrationally. For example, when a misunderstanding arises between Bayleigh and the hero, Long Quiet, rather than explain her situation and clear up all the problems, Bayleigh keeps ""forgetting"" to talk to him, or missing her opportunity. Very clumsily handled overall; none of the characters are believable in their motivations or behaviors.Also, no author should use the word ""manroot"" in what is intended to be a serious love scene.

What's worse, it seems that even if you do get it seated right, over time it shifts causing the vibration noise again. I am extremely unhappy with this. Sure, it looks nice and is convenient, but unless you have total hearing loss or live in an assembly plant, the noise makes it a worthless purchase. I'd give it zero stars if I could.",__label__1

Invader Zim is a quirky, dark cartoon that never got a fair shake from Nickelodeon because of shows like Rugrats clogging up the airwaves. Anyone who's wandered into a Hot Topic in the past few years knows what a cash-cow Viacom missed out on by cutting this series short. That being said, these DVD's don't do the show justice.

It is like explaining gravity to someone who doesn't understand the Newton's law itself. ""Because Newton says so"" wouldn't work.

Tried to set it up using USB connection: No-go. But the problem was in my HP8490 computer. Parallel setup was extremely easy. I have had a couple of false error signals, but nothing I can't live with. Fewer than with any of the Canon or HP printers I've had. The BW print is crisp and clear, was used to print registries for a worldwide military association. In fact, my boss and I were so impressed with this printer that we purchased one to use to print invoices at our office. The black and white quality of this printer is better than the $500.00 HP1220 Professional Ink Jet printer we own. I haven't compared the color quality yet.

I am not sure why Xerox does it that way, but the drivers do install quite easily.Print quality is great, and you have four levels of detail.

Since this is a figure that is both reviled and lionized, I think the author's purpose was to present all sides to this complex person and let the reader come to his own conclusions. Chernow's research of Rockefeller's childhood reveals a lot about the way he turned out as an adult, and the author's writing style points out both his strengths and shortcomings as well as showing how Standard Oil's rise to the top came about and the ruthless actions Rockefeller took to get it there. In the latter part of the book, as Rockefeller retires and ages, the book concentrates mostly on John Jr. as well as his daughters and heirs.

233917," Slow, confusing, frustrating: After hearing and reading so many positive reviews of ME, I thought I'd give it a try. ME has a lot going for it -- a rich story, great graphics, and hours of gameplay. The only trouble is that the game is incredibly tedious. I spent at least two hours at the beginning just running around a space station jib-jabbing with people, and getting completely lost in the process. They tell you to go here, then there, then back again...ugh.Then when something entertaining does actually take place, they don't give you enough checkpoints. One mission I was nearly 30 minutes into, then *bam* -- I died from a fluke and had to start all over again.I really wanted to like ME, but it's a drag.",__label__1

Leveling up frequently keeps you interested in developing your character for combat.Dialogue:The dialogue is well written. Characters are believable and interesting.Storyline:This is what makes the game five-star worthy. It pulled me in from the very beginning and never let go. When I finished the game, I just started it right back up and through again. And again. And every time I did that, I enjoyed it more. Until ME2 came out, and then ME3 (which I have not finished).If you need fast-paced shooter action, this isn't the game for you. If you prefer plot and character development, you might fall in love with this game's cast and story. I did.",__label__2 
233921," Awful Follow-Up to KOTOR: Let me say Knights of the Old Republic is one of my favorite RPGs of all time. The way they meshed turn-based combat with real time was a revelation that no game has since matched. But this game was boring as hell. I played it for over 5 hours, and all it seemed to me was a running simulator with a bad third person shooter mechanic thrown in. Sure, the conversation mechanic was interesting for the first 10 minutes or so, but after a while it was like watching a movie I had to also direct, instead of just enjoying it. Generic sci-fi themes also abounded, lacking the cohesiveness of the Star Wars universe for an underlying premise. I would say Bioware is great at interpreting a story that has already been realized for them, but awful at trying to come up with an original concept, AND executing it in an interesting fashion.",__label__1

233950," Not for everyone.: I love RPGs, both PC and console. I've played the big names, and whichever of the little ones I could find. So, of course, I tried Morrowind. To be honest, most people either love or hate this game. I can see where the love comes from - Morrowind is a party of aesthetic goodness. It boasts a gigantic world where freedom reigns. It also has a great community backing it up with fantastic unofficial add-ons. However, I can also see where the hate comes from. I do lean to that side after all. The combat and magic systems are terrible. The NPCs are lifeless and their dialogue equally drab. With freedom comes a feeling of aimlessness.Don't get too caught up in the ""Game of the Year"" title, or rave reviews - bad reviews neither. If you get the chance, try the game first.

The pin spots are about the length of my hand and the diameter of my fist, they are of surprisingly excellent quality. I won't be using them for these centerpieces as there is not a plug at each table. After reading other reviews I was nervous about the quality of the disco balls, but out of the 18 I ordered every one of my disco balls spin and only one lost a mirror tile, but it was directly next to the mount and no one will ever notice it is missing.I highly recommend these.",__label__2

Sarah Brady made it her personal mission to put the NRA out of business to keep us all safe from the senseless gun violence that changed her life forever.

I found the characters (especially Casey) to be believable and sympathetic (the good guys, that is!). The initial scenes when Casey is stranded are quite creepy, and the ending is chilling! I especially liked Casey's resourcefulness and generally tough nature. The Savannah setting is well developed and adds a nice regional touch. Overall, I would recommend it to anyone wanting a captivating suspense novel with some local color. Take it on YOUR next trip!",__label__2

I know when I actually went out with a White friend of mine and another girl, I felt VERY uncomfortable because I didn't want the attention. I didn't want people to think that I was dating him. All it was was a great game of bowling. But even still, it felt weird. I can read stories and watch movies like ""Something New"" till the cows come home but I don't ever want to experience it.

The author aderes to this genre's basic formula, but with a little twist. The IR theme added a little flava to the book and I read it in one sitting. Renee is a social worker and Tag is one of Manhattan's most eligible bachelors. Despite the color difference, they decide to persue a relationship with each other. This decision leads to malicious gossip by coworkers and has Renee rethinking whether she wants to remain involved with Tag. Tag does his best to put her at ease, but Renee ultimately has to come to terms with the implications of their relationship on her own. Does she follow her heart or bow down to what society dictates is proper. Delaney's Desert Sheikh was far better, but this book did not disappoint me.",__label__2

The reason for this has nothing to do with Showtime being greedy. The pilot is also owned by Hallmark, the other episodes are not. Hallmark has a distribution deal with a large video chain (rhymes with RockLuster), so it had to be done this way. If this DVD does well the remaining episodes will follow. This pilot received rave reviews (and made the NY Times list of Best 10 programs of 2003) and should not be penalized because only the pilot is available (so far.)

The use of strings in songs like ""When I was a Painter"" and the spine-tinglingly good ""Oh!"" really works and raises the songs to a new level. Also it turns out that Kim is amazing singer, I don't know why she didnt sing lead much in the Pixies. I mean I knew she was good but she really breaks your heart into a million pieces.

As one who likes a sharp knife when cooking, I just wanted something to dress the edge quickly, reliably, and as often as I wanted to without a lot of hassle. After doing my research on the Internet, I decided to try this a year ago. It is nothing short of great. It met all my criteria and now we always have sharp cutlery no matter what type straight or serrated edge. I even use it on my meat clever. I liked it so much that all my family members are getting them as stocking stuffers for Christmas this year. I'll never have to complain about dull knives when I am cooking at their houses.

234019, Save your time and money: I fundamentally agree with the Kirkus Review. Instead of keeping you on the edge of your seat Saylor keeps you asleep in your seat. In no manner can he (in the case of this book) be compared with Caleb Carr. All too often during the development of his plot does he take off on lengthy detours that totally destroy whatever tension or suspense that he is trying to develop i.e. the Female Clerks Bill. The book finally gets moving at the beginning of Part III on page 225. O. Henry's position as a protaganist is minimal. The conclusion is predictable as Saylor pretty much broadcasts it throughout the book. All in all a tedious and boring book.,__label__1

The book makes some very simplistic judgments about the historical nature of conflicts and adds huge amount of weights towards some abstract ""civilizational"" construct of human life.

Other issues are that when printing an image, many times it will print the image on six different pages even though it shows in the print preview it will print on one page. I have tried dealing with the support and the response (when I finally get one) is that it should work. They have no idea how to help me other than to say delete the program and reload it.

Yes, Nick Warren is one of my favorite DJ's, but this DVD is his worst work. Maybe the mix is ""not that bad"" (Personally, i think that the one from Saeed and Palash is better). From what i think they had better released it as normal audio CD's as the images have no quality (looks like a home video of a discoteque with some poor computer graphics and some landscapes of Ibiza, with not a good edition, very very poor images), and also the interviews with Sasha and Tenaglia..well, i think that a 2 minutes segment in Entertainment Tonight is better.",__label__1

It took me an hour to beat the first time, and every time I played through after that, trying to squeeze a few extra play hours before it go boring (it still hasn't)... it got increasingly frustrating. The bosses get tougher every time through, and if you choose characters in certain combinations, you can get new characters for multiplayer and new story pieces.

Also the Story lines for each character aren't worth playing them through either. When you've seen one you've pretty much seen them all except for a few scenes and different phrases.

234052," Awsome look but game is very lacking: The movies and grafics are very well done, and over all the game looks nice, but the down side is that the game leads you by the nose from fight to fight, showing you what you do, without any control of movement or even what you say.

234054," Bounce youre way out of here: I should start out with saying that this game is not a traditional game from Squaresoft, it is like a jazzed up version of Streets of Rage or something. It has many good things about it, and many bad things.First off, graphics are amazing, and dialog sounds different instead of having that robotic sound to it. By all means this is a great game, it's got story, it's pretty fun, and it has the hugest replay value of any game ever.However, the game is extremely short, about an hour or two, depending if you skip movies or not.

First, there needs to be a section in the front of the book on pronunciation. Second, there needs to be an alphabetical list of vocabulary words in the back of the book. Third, it needs to be updated, some of the slang is a little outdated. Fourth, it would be great if it had an accompanying cassette or CD.If these four things were done, I think it would be BY FAR the best introductory language book on the market. It has great strengths--logical, bite-sized lessons, useful vocabulary, clear explanations of important grammar. But it needs a bit of tweaking. Adrienne, are you listening? W.W.

The most interesting part is when he has to be a god, a criminal, a monk, an ambassador and what not, and the incredible scene where the mob boss explains his philosophy of lying openly to the women he lies to.

After that Gene and Dean sound more silly for the most part (with the exception of 'Sarah', which sounds like a pretty ode).

234128," Overall Good Quality: Overall good service from this little thing. Here's a few things that went wrong already: when going to George Washington Bridge in NY, it suggested a slightly longer alternate route right before entering the bridge. It may be that it didn't know of a new, shorter path to the bridge. No problem there. On our way back into NYS, right after the bridge, it lost track of its path and it froze. We tried re-entering the address, but it wouldn't turn back on. Only after we reset it did it come back, even then, with a delay.I think that if you need only the basics of navigation, (and some POIs) without all the bells and whistles, it's a great buy at the price of $160.",__label__2 
234129," Just right!: The packaging for this unit was outstanding. I was concerned about ordering such a fragile item online but it arrived in perfect condition. Picture quality is flawless, breathtaking?. Sound is excellent. Overall it's a terrific value for the money. Best of all, it's not too big, and not too little.",__label__2 
234130," Not a good buy: I have a 30"" audiovox LCD already, and I was shocked at how much better the picture on the audivox was compared to the Syntax. The product specs say the Syntax is a better telivision but the proof is in the picture. The picture quality was very poor and the colors are just not normal tones. If you plan on hooking up your cable with this TV, buy a differnet TV. The picture is very poor quality. I was very disapointed.",__label__1 
234131," Distortion in Aspect except 4::3: You'll see a circle as a circle only on Aspect 4:3. The other aspect ""zoom"" make the circle looks like an egg. No adjustment in vertical or Horizontal. The manual stated the ""ZOOM"" will enlarge the 4:3 without distortion. But it is not, it enlarged more in Horizontal than Vertical. Tech Support said that it is pre-set in manufacture, they can't correct it. I need the ZOOM aspect to watch the wide screen movie.I compare it with Westinghouse, the Westinghouse is better, more options, easier use on Remote.Some credits I have to give to both TV is that No Dead Pixel.",__label__1 
234132," My favorite of Michael's work: OK, let's face it, Michael Feinstein isn't for everyone. Some people think he's too sappy, a weaker Frank Sinatra, and so on. That said, I think this album is for everyone. From his eloquent cover of Van Morrison's ""Moondance"" to his own ""Half of April"" each and every one of these songs is performed with heart and a gentle touch. This is very much unlike his ""songbook"" albums - where he takes one composer's work and does it to death - which is what generally comes to mind with Michael's work , here there is a more eclectic style that gives you a truer sense of the great range and talent he posesses.",__label__2 
234133," One of Feinstein's Best!: Feinstein sings several standards wonderfully but the real attraction for me is his going to songs that are not as well known. He has lovely, mellow versions of Soon, Time Enough for Love, and I'll Be There. This is one of my favorite CD's which is always a pleasure to hear.",__label__2 
234134," Wonderful product: My sister recommended this product when I complained about my peeling nails. It has worked wonders for me for several years now. I hope to always be able to order it from Amazon.com.As one review already mentioned, I now have to actually cut my nails off to keep them from being TOO LONG!",__label__2 
234135," Glad that I didn't pay for it.: I was really glad that after reading ""Elegance"" by Kathleen Tessaro that I didn't pay for it. I really had high hopes for this book. It looked like that it was going to be good book, but the truth is that it was not a good book. Louise Canova is a American living in London married to an English actor. At thirty-two she acts like at lease fifteen years older. Until she finds a book called ""Elegance"" by Madame Dariaux in a second hand shop. This small book leads Louise to make some major changes in her life.This is really not that good. The author left major wholes the story that just didn't sense to me. I kept hoping that Ms. Tessaro would fill in the holes, but she didn't.The reason that I gave ""Elegance"" two stars is because of the work of Madame Dariaux,who's book will be selling on Amazon.com in August.",__label__1 
234136," No sympathy for this narrator: I agree with much of what Abby said, below. This book is very disappointing. If you are expecting a fun, witty Helen Fielding-style book, you're going to be disappointed.Tessaro breaks a most basic rule of writing by telling the reader how the main characters are feeling rather than showing it. It feels forced. But the main problem I have with this book is that the main character, Louise, is very unappealing. She comes across as selfish and shallow and self-obsessed. Tessaro obviously wants us to think ""you go, girl!"" when Louise tells us about flirting openly with her husbands' colleagues; instead, I marvelled at how I was supposed to like a character who did these kinds of pathetic things. Finally, the whole premise of the book is weak - that by wearing tight clothes and putting on makeup, you can transform your life. Louise may become more physically attractive, but that doesn't change the fact that her character, like this book, leaves much to be desired.",__label__1 
234137, very dissapoint that i read this book: while i was ready to buy this book one of my friends informed me that she already had it and gave it to me. The only precious reading in this book is the first page of each chapter that references to Antoine Darioux.For my opinion is the only information you can take concerning elegnce. The rest material is information that are worthless regarding to elegance and i have surely been beglamoured by the tittle.,__label__1

234140," I am so glad I never purchased the movie!: If you have the choice between watching the old versions of the Twillight Zone and Uninvited Guest, watch the Twillight Zone. My eyebrow was arched in confusion the whole time... and all I could think was... ""This is Bull!"". The whole movie in theory was a big 'free-writing' assignment. The plot(s) had no rhyme or reason.

If you look at the reviews listed on this page, several loved it, several hated it and some were in between. Which tells you that reveiws don't mean a thing. The only review that matters is yours when you see it. I thought it was very entertaining and there were some cheesy parts but for the most part, I enjoyed it.W.S.",__label__2 
234142," One of Webb's Best: Amazon needs to get the Bob Wills album cover down from the site, the one for Suspending Disbelief would be more appropriate! This is far from Jimmy Webb's last album, but certainly one of his best. His fans know what a treat this CD was when it first came out (1992), (first in 10 years)...after seven years I'm still listening to it. Best songs: Too Young To Die, I Don't Know How To Love You Anymore, Elvis & Me, and the Grand Finale....I Will Arise...a ""Copelandesque"" version of some old standard hymns. Only the genius of Jimmy Webb could conceive of this and pull it off so well.",__label__2 
234143," Good album, but not his best: Too Young To Die and Elvis And Me are great songs on this one. The rest is pleasant enough, but not as good as Letters, Words & Music or And So On (which hasn't appeared on CD).",__label__2 
234144," Amazing!: This CD is truly amazing! No one can sing the Hanuman Chalesa like Krishna Das. Every variation of this song is beautiful and the additional CD of pronunciation is incredibly helpful for those of us who would like to learn how to sing along with Krishna Das' incredible voice. Every time I play this CD during one of my yoga classes, I have students asking for the name of the CD at the end of class. This CD moves me to my soul every time I listen to it. Even my five-year old tells me that listening to his CD ""makes his heart happy"". This is a must-have CD!",__label__2

I have had it for about three years now and finally threw it away the other day because I had just had enough of the issues. It constantly binds up. The tension knob was a problem.

234153," Glad it worked for others, not for me.: This is the worst machine I have ever used!!!! I've been sewing for over 30 years, and have used many different brands. Maybe I just got a bad machine, but it makes me hate sewing. Very unstable, tension is always out of wack, and it can't sew through more than two layers of thicker fabric.",__label__1 
234154, This machine is horrid fr beginners: There is no way to slow down the speed at all! It goes full speed or no speed and bunches up the fabric horribly. I had planned on sewing on paper first but it was just way fast. I returned it. Don't buy it.,__label__1 
234155," Mouth Pleasing and Healthy Too!: WOW! I am impressed with these snacks. A whole apple in each bar and no added suger of any kind! I love the convenience of these fruit bars. We snack mostly on fruit here in the house, but sometimes it's not convenient to carry fruit with you on outings. So I've been looking for something like this for a long time and it's better than I expected, much better than most fruit leathers you can find in a health store.These strawberry snacks have also been tested by a three and four year old pallet and they always ask for more.They're so good I've ordered more of another flavor.",__label__2 
234156," Taste like a pureed apple with some strawberry flavoring: I can't believe how wonderful all the reviews were of this snack. I was expecting a strawberry chewy snack, but got an apple with some strawberry flavoring. Really this is not what you expect. It has a mushed up apple consistency.

234160," Working Hard: It's very simple- Jillian Michaels is a beast. If you are not ready for this workout it will kick your butt and your legs will be wobbling and sore for a couple of days. My suggestion is to ease into it. Do a couple of sets a day for maybe a week before jumping into the whole workout. None of the moves are difficult on their own but put the whole workout together and it's pretty tough for the average person.If you want to buy it, I'd say go for it, it will get you the results you want as long as you use it regularly. Good luck!",__label__2 
234161," One Seriously Tought Workout: This workout is tough and I like it! This video hits all of the major muscle groups and uses the same circuit training techniques that Jillian employes in the 30 day Shred.

If you are ready to increase your stength and stamina, this is a great video to add to your collection.",__label__2 
234162," It works if you do!!: I have been using this video for about 2 weeks now. I do it in alteration with 2 other videos by Jillian. I have dropped about 6 inches so far. Of course you get out of it what you put in, so I am getting expected results. She really delivers what she promises. I am an athletic person and she works muscles I didn't know I had.

It seems to send out some kind of an alert when played on a computer. I was able to watch the bonus features which was just an ill conceived infomercial for an electric toothbrush.

(my legs and butt have never been so sore) So i know it works!!I would recomend for beginners to do this dvd the first time without hand weights. Your legs and butt will still get a great workout.I really liked it because I am so sore, so I know it works! Just a little scared for when I do it again :) enjoy!",__label__2

I was looking for something a little different so I decided to give Jillian a try after trying one of her free workouts from my On Demand Cable workout channel. That workout got me interested in trying more of JM's stuff.I got this workout based on the reviews, and I have not been disappointed. This workout is tough and it hurts! Jillian's ""surrender"" move makes me want to give up, and her ab work is killer. I also like the length of this workout and really feel like I did something when it is done. It really does work the ""trouble zone"" and when it was over I was sore in all the right places (abs, glutes, shoulders, triceps, and legs).Overall, I am a Jillian convert. I hate her during the workout, but I love her when it is done :)",__label__2
