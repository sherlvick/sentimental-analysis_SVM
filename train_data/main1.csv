0," One of the best game music soundtracks - for a game I didn't really play: Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game, the music I heard (plus the connection to Chrono Trigger which was great as well) led me to purchase the soundtrack, and it remains one of my favorite albums. There is an incredible mix of fun, epic, and emotional songs. Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like, as there's not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks. I must admit that one of the songs (Life-A Distant Promise) has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs, which I find distracting. But even if those weren't included I would still consider the collection worth it.",__label__2

8," Not an ""ultimate guide"": Firstly,I enjoyed the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader). However, I did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal. If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you.",__label__1

So, I begrudgingly clicked yes on the third try, and it installed quicktime 5, THEN it tells me to please install the quicktime available on the disc. It KEPT telling me that, even after I uninstalled my version of quicktime 7.5, and reinstalled Barbie Rapunzel and quicktime 5. Very frustrating, and the game absolutely will not work for me. It keeps telling me over and over, to install quicktime 5, tho I've been through the installation process repeatedly. It is NOT my ""operating system limitations"". This is a brand new computer...merely weeks old with all the state of the art contraptions.",__label__1 
12, TRULY MADE A DIFFERENCE!: I have been using this product for a couple years now. I started using it because my hair had gotten so dry from all the chemical treatments and relaxers. This actualy came in the relaxer kit. I tried it and could not beleive the difference it made with one use. I could not find it in any of the stores at the time so I searched Amazon and they had it. I absolutely love it. It is the best moisturizing product I have used so far. My hair is soft with good elasticity and it is not breaking anywhere close to what it was. I am very happy with it.,__label__2

15," Simple, Durable, Fun game for all ages: This is an AWESOME game! Almost everyone know tic-tac-toe so it is EASY to learn and quick to play. You can't play just once! The twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes - just big enough to gobble up your opponent. The first person to make tic-tac-toe wins, but it's not as easy as it looks when you're stuck in the mindset of just making three in a row and forget about the gobbling possibilities!

As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (70MB on dial up!), and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that).

I love Ash.The entire Night World seris is the bomb. I read mostly everyone of L.J Smiths book and they all are awesome. I think Ash and Mary Lynetee are one of the sweetest soulmates. I loved how they tried to fight there feelings but couldn't. There should be real guys like Ash,Quinn,Juliun,Damon,Gabriel and I can go on forever.

37," Book of Chance: I had just finished reading 'The Food of Love' by Anthony Capella since I had nothing to do, but read. Mind you, reading is one of my favorite pastimes.I had recently bought a series of books. The Food of Love was just one of the books I just picked up so I can get that 'three for the price of two' deal at Waterstones in London (British's equivalent of Barnes&Noble;). I wasn't really interested, but it was one of the more interesting options I had. Well, I'm glad I made the right choice! I started reading it last night and I haven't put it down since.If you love food and a little romance, which I am both fond of, it's an excellent book to read. Mr. Capella was remarkably thorough in his description of the rich and textured Italian dishes that the words assails you with a sense of smell and taste that leaves you hungry for more. This book took me by surprise and I'm sure you would not be disappointed.",__label__2 
38," Light reading, light in substance: A clichéd storyline based on the classic Cyrano de Bergerac, this book reads like a rookie novel written by someone who has a knowledge and passion for Italian culture and cuisine, but little experience in developing a story. I can understand Bruno and his passion for cooking, but have no clue as to his passion for Laura. It seems to be primarily based on her being a blonde American. How exotic. Her character is so underdeveloped- we know she's studying art history, and she enjoys Bruno's cooking with a passion. That's about it. And Tomasso, he's just the cliché for any over-sexed Mediterranean male who encounters foreign females.It's a light and entertaining read if you can get beyond all of the reasons you should put it down and walk away. That being said, I will, however, check out this author's more recent novels. He does seem to have a way with technical details, hopefully his storytelling has caught up.",__label__1

41," Real HTML for people who build sites for a living: This book is simply great! If you build sites for a living you probably struggle with books that trivialize HTML and present its syntax willy-nilly. This book is the ONLY book I've ever seen that actually seems to be written by someone who builds sites professionally and wants to know all the markup. It explains logical and physical tagging styles well and does a really good job showing how to hook HTML with other technologies without trying to teach CGI, CSS, etc. at the same time. The only thing I wish is that this guy would write a JavaScript or DHTML book. I'd buy that right away.",__label__2 
42," Marriage has its good and bad moments: This is a tear-jerker mixed with humor. A lot of rough patches for this couple but don't let that scare you off because there are also a lot of good times, too. I watch this movie often as I am a hopeless romantic and I thoroughly enjoy the music and dancing (Hindi style & Pop Rock mix), plus it's worth wading through the tears to get to the fun parts.

45," More Romance Please and Less Mystery!!: the reason i gave two stars when I usually give 5 stars for ms. feehan's books is b/c this book was tooooooo mystery/gothic genre rather than romance. I really didn't feel like the two main characters were in love, in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroine's point of view and I was getting sick of her whining and her point of view. unlike the ""dark"" series, you really didnt feel any passion. the book is better suited for the mystery/gothic genre and NOT romance.even the mystery was not that good! its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages. throughout the entire book, you're kept in suspense of who was the bad guy, if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of pages....Ms. Feehan, if your reading, please focuse more on the main characters relation to each other rather then distract us with so much unamusing mystery!",__label__1 
46," A Lost Author: I have read all of the Carpathian novels to date, except one. I very much enjoyed them at first, but nothing EVER gets resolved. You would think that after 16 books something would have been resolved and a new obstacle introduced. As for this book, it is an off-shoot of another Carpathian novel about the Jaguar Line. I was hoping to find out more about this curse, the origins and why the males kill the females. Nothing, not a word about the Jaguar curse. And why do the walls and ceilings change? Ideas introduced and left at that. Ms. Feehan went, once again, off on a tagent. Her books become less and less meaty and more and more expensive.

Her books just get better and better as you go through the Kay Scarpetta series.I really enjoy the series concept and the fact that some of the same characters keep returning from book to book. It's nice to see the characters develop through each story line. It allows you to get comfortable with them, get close to them, and get frustrated with them when they do something out of character.I highly recommend reading not just this book but the entire Kay Scarpetta series.",__label__2 
49," Best of the First Four in this series.: This is an awesome book. Kay just keeps getting better and better. It's also fun to see the characters develop more with each book - Kay herself as she seems to be always ""one against the world"", Marino who it appears is heading towards some sort of heart attack, Lucy who seems to be getting more and more quixotic. In this book Kay finds herself smack in the middle of a series of gruesome killings. It appears that a recently executed murderer, who Kay herself has seen on her autopsy table, is still around committing crimes. A number of murders occur where the executed murderer's fingerprints are turning up. Kay, Marino and Benton try to track a killer, but it appears that the corruption goes up a long ways into the political stratosphere. This is a taut and totally believable thriller.

In this edition she's made some changes. Cheap shopping is listed and the luxe, nowhere else except NYC stores are listed as well. She must have gotten some younger helpers because much to my delight the Sean Jean store and and Triple Five Soul shop are mentioned too. One thing I've always liked about the Born to Shop series is that the advice shows you how to get around town safely, how to buy quality and how to have a good time with as few hassles as possible.

If you were a fan of the other games then you will definately love this game.The graphics are better and the controls( though they'vechanged a little bit) are easy to get used to.The biggest downfall the game has is that you do not start out playing as Dante, but some new kid named Nero. However, once you start playing as Nero you'll find out just how cool he is too. In some of the gaming mags I've read the reviewers liked playing Nero more than Dante. I personally like playing Dante more, but hey, Nero is still very cool.The only other thing left to say about the game is that it's a true DMC game. The story and attitude of the characters are all there. The beautiful women and strange demons are in the game too. If you own a PS3 then buy this game. If you are getting a PS3 then get this game.

I'm hoping that if I keep washing it it will soften up. It's just one of those blankets that when you put it over someone it stays in the same shape until you bring it closer to you. At this point my son uses a different blanket when he goes to bed. One that is much softer and lays over him completely with out creating little air vents. I love the look of the set but was disapointed with the quality of it. Maybe it'll get better with washing.",__label__1

233692," Well, it's ... different.: Keeping an open mind, I was prepared to read an objective work on modern day ""cults,"" which, oddly enough, include almost every world religion. What I found was a completely biased, mean-spirited jab at every belief system that didn't smack of hard-core Christianity. No one, but the most rabid Christian, could possibly find this book interesting, enlightening, or even entertaining. It is an insult that a Baptist minister chooses to wield immaturity and prideful judgement as a weapon against others.

Have you ever wanted to know why the Seventh Day Adevtise Church is the way it is? Or have you wanted to always know how Islam, Mormons or Jehovah Witnesses got their start? Everything in Walter Martin's book is based upon hard facts found in magazines, court cases and documented sources. This book will open your eyes and make you realize the fabrications that many cults and religions have painstaikingly gone through to create the illusion of what is the truth. Walter Martin's Kingdom of the Cults opens these falsehoods to the light of day and it gives Christians the tools to have intelligent and rational discussions with a person who believes one of these ruses. It is a tantamount book, resourceful, direct and above all it is the truth.",__label__2 
233694, Kingdom of the Cults: Excellent and informative book! I was a bit surprised to see that the Seventh Day Adventists are no longer considered a cult in spite of the fact that I know they still are very much focused on the teaching of Ellen G. White.,__label__2 
233695," You , too, might be a cultist (if you're not a fundie) !: How are we supposed to tke a book seriously that lumps Islam (a major world religion that inculdes nearly 1/4 of the world's population) in with small fringe groups like the Moonies. It is simply a fact that the world ""cult"" is only appropriate when used to denote groups that are small, extremely authoritarian (i.e. centered around a strong leader with unchecked power over the members) and outside the maintream of any major tradition. A world religion is by definition not a cult. Niether is a well established liberal Protestant denomination like the Unitarian Church a cult. If any group that is not conservative Protestant is a cult (which seem to be Martin's basic premise), then why doesn't he call Judaism, Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy cults?

Very helpful for me in understanding where people I know are coming from.",__label__2 
233697," Modern mob adventure: This is really an underrated film about a group of criminals working in Los Angeles. The story involves strong loyalty among gang members, but also betrayal and greed by one of its members. Some of the scenes are raw and gripping, and the police are not always angels. Los Angeles comes alive as the focal point for this film, and it's engaging to consider the way criminals devise schemes to rob from the rich and then become emulators of the wealthy.",__label__2 
233698," Nice looking magazine rack: Overall, it's a nice looking magazine rack. It's not solid wood, as I expected - it's the type of wood you would expect to see on Target furniture. The metal hardware also broke for me (as it did in the other user's review) - but luckily I had another one on hand. Those parts just aren't very reliable. The price may be a bit high. But I was unable to find a style that I liked as much as this one. Overall, I am pleased with it and it is doing a good job holding all my magazines.",__label__2 
233699," Coast to coast fiasco: Arthur, please leave Florida to the likes of Carl Hiaasen or Elmore Leonard. Your novel failed short in its depiction of our favorite state. The cast of characters wasn't excessively long, but the individual storylines were poorly developed. All the coincidences!: the FBI agent who falls for the car-collector woman who sells her red Jaguar to the parents of the teenage bank robber who ""killed"" a senator with an asthma attack... The vicious and beautiful killer, her lovely parents, her psychic blind daughter... How forced and convoluted. I prefer simpler novels. This is not it.",__label__1

The vendor decided that Alaska did not apply and cancelled the order which was a gift for a loved one which of course did not arrive as scheduled. Clearly this could have shipped United States postal if the vendor was concerned for the customer but in this case it was cancelled after taking their time as well. I would not use any vendor other than Amazon direct. They have never pulled this on me after many many orders sent to Alaska. Beware of this vendor!!!,__label__1

233702," Just one complaint: This game has greatly improved from its previous installments. But there is one thing that continues to annoy me, that is the repetitive game play. The enemies do change quite a bit but you run into similar enemies way more often than you should in my opinion. But the graphics are great all the way around. The new styles and weapons are very fun in every way. Also the story is interesting more so than any of the previous DMC games. I would recommend this game for anyone who wants to enjoy Devil May Cry one last time at its peak. This game is worth a look.",__label__2 
233703," Don't buy this product: Many of the reviews here are accurate and valuable. The most important piece of advice is to contact Linksys and see if your printer is supported. Having set the environment up with my HP OfficeJet K60 everything seems fine. When I go to print however, the application recognizes the printer and even knows what port it is connected on. Unfortunately, everything I print goes into a black hole. After calling Linksys support, they tell me that looking through their internal list it shows a number of poor people like myself who have tried and failed to get the K60 working, so they ""assume"" its not supported.When I asked if I could get a copy of the list indicating what is supported, I was told its an internal only document. So its trial and error if you have this product.Like other reviews, they recommended that I upgrade to the WPS11 server.

I was taken by the variety and inventiveness of many of the recipes where various ingredients are combined in very clever ways in order to get not only the flavour but also the correct texture.I particularly like the recipes for raw lasagna, sushi and dolmas. These are great for surprising the non-raw with the possibilities of food in its natural state.

It really shows how ignorant the general public is about reptiles... they seem to just accept the information because it is published by a PhD.Reading this, and considering it good is like reading a children's book about a construction company, and trying to builda house with it.

233714," It does what it's supposed to: I've read some of the reviews about this product and the biggest complaint seems to be that the head sometimes gets water on the garment. I only get spots when I try and use it on something laid flat because the water condenses in the head. It will also condense in the hose and if the hose drops below the steamer it gurgles. This really is not a tabletop item, it has to be used on the floor. I've used it on just about all my cloths: khakis, polos, button-down shirts and it does a reasonably good job. If I have one complaint about it, it is that the cord is too short. and with the steamer on the floor, it will barely reach the top of an item hung using the over-the-door hook. I also wish it had a way to fill the reservoir (which is only 8 oz.) with out removing the hose.

233721, Not worth it: I got this product thinking that it would replace my iron and ironing board - I was wrong! It is not strong enough to take the wrinkles out of khaki pants or oxford shirts that are a cotton/polyester blend. The clothes do not hold their shape either. It took me longer to steam a pair of pants than it would have for me to just iron them because of how you have to tough at the pants to make the fabric straight for the steamer. I guess I was looking for an easy way out of ironing and this product was definitely not it!,__label__1

This bra is just a thin piece of material in front, which is hard to tell from just online pictures. I have wanted to return mine, but am not sure if it's too late or not.

233733, Complete Deparature from Everything Good in Resident Evil series: We were so excited to buy this game we bought it the day it came out without reading any reviews. Big mistake! We had loved all the other Resident Evil games so much that we had faith this one would also be great. You cannot even control the characters in the game and it's basically just target practice for you and your Wii controller. None of the story line is new. It's all scenes from previous games. Our favorite aspect of previous Resident Evil games is the puzzle-like quality where you need to collect things and figure out how to use them later on in the game. This game required no thinking whatsoever. Very disappointing. $50 down the drain for 15 minutes of disappointment.,__label__1

Who coiuld ever believe the Darcy's would get caught up in something like this!",__label__1 
233742," Plot was lame. Started OK but no other redeeming features.: As other reviewers describe, the language is not period (or British) and the plot is horrid. Anachronisms all over the place, especially in the newly introduced characters. The American characters and the Black Magic themes do not work at all.I agree with the reviewers who found the beginning of the book mildly intriguing, with a nice relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth. The book goes downhill from the point when the Darcys discover the newly married Caroline (Bingley) walking in the gutter in the middle of the night.The characterizations of the original P&P; characters are good, the settings and wit are mostly acceptable, but none are excellent or inspiring enough to even begin to overcome the plot deficiencies.This one a loser.

However, it is riddled with errors regarding U.S. manufacturers. For instance, it shows a photo of a Mount Horeb, Wisconsin fire truck and claims it's in Canada. The authors do not seem to know that Crown Firecoach went out of business in the '80s and Pirsch did so in the '90s. The coverage of Pierce is pathetically short given its prominence in the U.S. market. If I can find these errors about U.S. companies in just five minutes, one can only wonder how many more there for manufacturers from other countries that I have much less knowledge of.

Of course, these books are prominently displayed, as the right-wing will go into hysterics if they were not and cry ""LIBERAL CABAL!!!""The Gambler Bennett, well, he's broke even with his new manual on how to convince the world on the need to end moral decline once and for all in the United States, especially after the wretched events of 9/11. And of course, The Gambler has all the answers to our problems.

For example, gambling is legal but many find this distasteful so is gambling not a decent thing to do? T But the big fault I have with this book is that Mr. Bennett tells us that we must sacrifice but Mr. Bennett has not sacrificed by serving in the military which for me makes him appear to be an elitist.",__label__1

What these pictures do not show is it is virtually impossible to put your chosen fuel into these cans. You need at least four hands and maybe more for the larger size cans. After my first time of trying to fill my mower from the one gallon can I realized the assorted safety virtues are there for those people who have no clue. Kind of like the ones who designed the can I suppose, unless the whole idea is if you can't get fuel into the can, you are safe. People whose hands are small have a hard time with these cans, people with large hands may have it easier. I spilled nearly the entire gallon when filling my mower, back to plastic I think.

Standouts are Kirwan's Something Inside of Me and Without You and, of course, the three Peter Green classics, Love That Burns, Albatross and Black Magic Woman. As one listens to Green wail on Magic it becomes crystal clear why both BB and Eric consider him to be one of the great guitarists.Had Fleetwood Mac not morphed into a mega pop band in 1976 they would still have occupied a significant position in the history of English blues.

That opinion or the majority of it has to be accepted as the proper answer. Second there is the problem with the wrongly dated death of Herod - he died in 1 BC and not in 4 BC. Furthermore there is the Quirinius-Problem. As Jack Finegan in his Handbook of Biblical Chronology (Princeton 1964) wrote, Sulpicius Quirinius was ruling in 3 and 2 BC. This would fit with the church fathers. The astronomical question: Much closer conjunctions we had in August 12, 3 BC, in June 17, 2 BC and in August 27, 2 BC.

Her character was completely annoying, as she seemed to behave completely inconsistently and irrationally. For example, when a misunderstanding arises between Bayleigh and the hero, Long Quiet, rather than explain her situation and clear up all the problems, Bayleigh keeps ""forgetting"" to talk to him, or missing her opportunity. Very clumsily handled overall; none of the characters are believable in their motivations or behaviors.Also, no author should use the word ""manroot"" in what is intended to be a serious love scene.

What's worse, it seems that even if you do get it seated right, over time it shifts causing the vibration noise again. I am extremely unhappy with this. Sure, it looks nice and is convenient, but unless you have total hearing loss or live in an assembly plant, the noise makes it a worthless purchase. I'd give it zero stars if I could.",__label__1

Invader Zim is a quirky, dark cartoon that never got a fair shake from Nickelodeon because of shows like Rugrats clogging up the airwaves. Anyone who's wandered into a Hot Topic in the past few years knows what a cash-cow Viacom missed out on by cutting this series short. That being said, these DVD's don't do the show justice.

It is like explaining gravity to someone who doesn't understand the Newton's law itself. ""Because Newton says so"" wouldn't work.

Tried to set it up using USB connection: No-go. But the problem was in my HP8490 computer. Parallel setup was extremely easy. I have had a couple of false error signals, but nothing I can't live with. Fewer than with any of the Canon or HP printers I've had. The BW print is crisp and clear, was used to print registries for a worldwide military association. In fact, my boss and I were so impressed with this printer that we purchased one to use to print invoices at our office. The black and white quality of this printer is better than the $500.00 HP1220 Professional Ink Jet printer we own. I haven't compared the color quality yet.

I am not sure why Xerox does it that way, but the drivers do install quite easily.Print quality is great, and you have four levels of detail.

Since this is a figure that is both reviled and lionized, I think the author's purpose was to present all sides to this complex person and let the reader come to his own conclusions. Chernow's research of Rockefeller's childhood reveals a lot about the way he turned out as an adult, and the author's writing style points out both his strengths and shortcomings as well as showing how Standard Oil's rise to the top came about and the ruthless actions Rockefeller took to get it there. In the latter part of the book, as Rockefeller retires and ages, the book concentrates mostly on John Jr. as well as his daughters and heirs.

233917," Slow, confusing, frustrating: After hearing and reading so many positive reviews of ME, I thought I'd give it a try. ME has a lot going for it -- a rich story, great graphics, and hours of gameplay. The only trouble is that the game is incredibly tedious. I spent at least two hours at the beginning just running around a space station jib-jabbing with people, and getting completely lost in the process. They tell you to go here, then there, then back again...ugh.Then when something entertaining does actually take place, they don't give you enough checkpoints. One mission I was nearly 30 minutes into, then *bam* -- I died from a fluke and had to start all over again.I really wanted to like ME, but it's a drag.",__label__1

Leveling up frequently keeps you interested in developing your character for combat.Dialogue:The dialogue is well written. Characters are believable and interesting.Storyline:This is what makes the game five-star worthy. It pulled me in from the very beginning and never let go. When I finished the game, I just started it right back up and through again. And again. And every time I did that, I enjoyed it more. Until ME2 came out, and then ME3 (which I have not finished).If you need fast-paced shooter action, this isn't the game for you. If you prefer plot and character development, you might fall in love with this game's cast and story. I did.",__label__2 
233921," Awful Follow-Up to KOTOR: Let me say Knights of the Old Republic is one of my favorite RPGs of all time. The way they meshed turn-based combat with real time was a revelation that no game has since matched. But this game was boring as hell. I played it for over 5 hours, and all it seemed to me was a running simulator with a bad third person shooter mechanic thrown in. Sure, the conversation mechanic was interesting for the first 10 minutes or so, but after a while it was like watching a movie I had to also direct, instead of just enjoying it. Generic sci-fi themes also abounded, lacking the cohesiveness of the Star Wars universe for an underlying premise. I would say Bioware is great at interpreting a story that has already been realized for them, but awful at trying to come up with an original concept, AND executing it in an interesting fashion.",__label__1

233950," Not for everyone.: I love RPGs, both PC and console. I've played the big names, and whichever of the little ones I could find. So, of course, I tried Morrowind. To be honest, most people either love or hate this game. I can see where the love comes from - Morrowind is a party of aesthetic goodness. It boasts a gigantic world where freedom reigns. It also has a great community backing it up with fantastic unofficial add-ons. However, I can also see where the hate comes from. I do lean to that side after all. The combat and magic systems are terrible. The NPCs are lifeless and their dialogue equally drab. With freedom comes a feeling of aimlessness.Don't get too caught up in the ""Game of the Year"" title, or rave reviews - bad reviews neither. If you get the chance, try the game first.

The pin spots are about the length of my hand and the diameter of my fist, they are of surprisingly excellent quality. I won't be using them for these centerpieces as there is not a plug at each table. After reading other reviews I was nervous about the quality of the disco balls, but out of the 18 I ordered every one of my disco balls spin and only one lost a mirror tile, but it was directly next to the mount and no one will ever notice it is missing.I highly recommend these.",__label__2

Sarah Brady made it her personal mission to put the NRA out of business to keep us all safe from the senseless gun violence that changed her life forever.

I found the characters (especially Casey) to be believable and sympathetic (the good guys, that is!). The initial scenes when Casey is stranded are quite creepy, and the ending is chilling! I especially liked Casey's resourcefulness and generally tough nature. The Savannah setting is well developed and adds a nice regional touch. Overall, I would recommend it to anyone wanting a captivating suspense novel with some local color. Take it on YOUR next trip!",__label__2

I know when I actually went out with a White friend of mine and another girl, I felt VERY uncomfortable because I didn't want the attention. I didn't want people to think that I was dating him. All it was was a great game of bowling. But even still, it felt weird. I can read stories and watch movies like ""Something New"" till the cows come home but I don't ever want to experience it.

The author aderes to this genre's basic formula, but with a little twist. The IR theme added a little flava to the book and I read it in one sitting. Renee is a social worker and Tag is one of Manhattan's most eligible bachelors. Despite the color difference, they decide to persue a relationship with each other. This decision leads to malicious gossip by coworkers and has Renee rethinking whether she wants to remain involved with Tag. Tag does his best to put her at ease, but Renee ultimately has to come to terms with the implications of their relationship on her own. Does she follow her heart or bow down to what society dictates is proper. Delaney's Desert Sheikh was far better, but this book did not disappoint me.",__label__2

The reason for this has nothing to do with Showtime being greedy. The pilot is also owned by Hallmark, the other episodes are not. Hallmark has a distribution deal with a large video chain (rhymes with RockLuster), so it had to be done this way. If this DVD does well the remaining episodes will follow. This pilot received rave reviews (and made the NY Times list of Best 10 programs of 2003) and should not be penalized because only the pilot is available (so far.)

The use of strings in songs like ""When I was a Painter"" and the spine-tinglingly good ""Oh!"" really works and raises the songs to a new level. Also it turns out that Kim is amazing singer, I don't know why she didnt sing lead much in the Pixies. I mean I knew she was good but she really breaks your heart into a million pieces.

As one who likes a sharp knife when cooking, I just wanted something to dress the edge quickly, reliably, and as often as I wanted to without a lot of hassle. After doing my research on the Internet, I decided to try this a year ago. It is nothing short of great. It met all my criteria and now we always have sharp cutlery no matter what type straight or serrated edge. I even use it on my meat clever. I liked it so much that all my family members are getting them as stocking stuffers for Christmas this year. I'll never have to complain about dull knives when I am cooking at their houses.

234019, Save your time and money: I fundamentally agree with the Kirkus Review. Instead of keeping you on the edge of your seat Saylor keeps you asleep in your seat. In no manner can he (in the case of this book) be compared with Caleb Carr. All too often during the development of his plot does he take off on lengthy detours that totally destroy whatever tension or suspense that he is trying to develop i.e. the Female Clerks Bill. The book finally gets moving at the beginning of Part III on page 225. O. Henry's position as a protaganist is minimal. The conclusion is predictable as Saylor pretty much broadcasts it throughout the book. All in all a tedious and boring book.,__label__1

The book makes some very simplistic judgments about the historical nature of conflicts and adds huge amount of weights towards some abstract ""civilizational"" construct of human life.

Other issues are that when printing an image, many times it will print the image on six different pages even though it shows in the print preview it will print on one page. I have tried dealing with the support and the response (when I finally get one) is that it should work. They have no idea how to help me other than to say delete the program and reload it.

Yes, Nick Warren is one of my favorite DJ's, but this DVD is his worst work. Maybe the mix is ""not that bad"" (Personally, i think that the one from Saeed and Palash is better). From what i think they had better released it as normal audio CD's as the images have no quality (looks like a home video of a discoteque with some poor computer graphics and some landscapes of Ibiza, with not a good edition, very very poor images), and also the interviews with Sasha and Tenaglia..well, i think that a 2 minutes segment in Entertainment Tonight is better.",__label__1

It took me an hour to beat the first time, and every time I played through after that, trying to squeeze a few extra play hours before it go boring (it still hasn't)... it got increasingly frustrating. The bosses get tougher every time through, and if you choose characters in certain combinations, you can get new characters for multiplayer and new story pieces.

Also the Story lines for each character aren't worth playing them through either. When you've seen one you've pretty much seen them all except for a few scenes and different phrases.

234052," Awsome look but game is very lacking: The movies and grafics are very well done, and over all the game looks nice, but the down side is that the game leads you by the nose from fight to fight, showing you what you do, without any control of movement or even what you say.

234054," Bounce youre way out of here: I should start out with saying that this game is not a traditional game from Squaresoft, it is like a jazzed up version of Streets of Rage or something. It has many good things about it, and many bad things.First off, graphics are amazing, and dialog sounds different instead of having that robotic sound to it. By all means this is a great game, it's got story, it's pretty fun, and it has the hugest replay value of any game ever.However, the game is extremely short, about an hour or two, depending if you skip movies or not.

First, there needs to be a section in the front of the book on pronunciation. Second, there needs to be an alphabetical list of vocabulary words in the back of the book. Third, it needs to be updated, some of the slang is a little outdated. Fourth, it would be great if it had an accompanying cassette or CD.If these four things were done, I think it would be BY FAR the best introductory language book on the market. It has great strengths--logical, bite-sized lessons, useful vocabulary, clear explanations of important grammar. But it needs a bit of tweaking. Adrienne, are you listening? W.W.

The most interesting part is when he has to be a god, a criminal, a monk, an ambassador and what not, and the incredible scene where the mob boss explains his philosophy of lying openly to the women he lies to.

After that Gene and Dean sound more silly for the most part (with the exception of 'Sarah', which sounds like a pretty ode).

234128," Overall Good Quality: Overall good service from this little thing. Here's a few things that went wrong already: when going to George Washington Bridge in NY, it suggested a slightly longer alternate route right before entering the bridge. It may be that it didn't know of a new, shorter path to the bridge. No problem there. On our way back into NYS, right after the bridge, it lost track of its path and it froze. We tried re-entering the address, but it wouldn't turn back on. Only after we reset it did it come back, even then, with a delay.I think that if you need only the basics of navigation, (and some POIs) without all the bells and whistles, it's a great buy at the price of $160.",__label__2

234132," My favorite of Michael's work: OK, let's face it, Michael Feinstein isn't for everyone. Some people think he's too sappy, a weaker Frank Sinatra, and so on. That said, I think this album is for everyone. From his eloquent cover of Van Morrison's ""Moondance"" to his own ""Half of April"" each and every one of these songs is performed with heart and a gentle touch. This is very much unlike his ""songbook"" albums - where he takes one composer's work and does it to death - which is what generally comes to mind with Michael's work , here there is a more eclectic style that gives you a truer sense of the great range and talent he posesses.",__label__2 
234133," One of Feinstein's Best!: Feinstein sings several standards wonderfully but the real attraction for me is his going to songs that are not as well known.

At thirty-two she acts like at lease fifteen years older. Until she finds a book called ""Elegance"" by Madame Dariaux in a second hand shop. This small book leads Louise to make some major changes in her life.This is really not that good. The author left major wholes the story that just didn't sense to me. I kept hoping that Ms. Tessaro would fill in the holes, but she didn't.The reason that I gave ""Elegance"" two stars is because of the work of Madame Dariaux,who's book will be selling on Amazon.com in August.",__label__1 
234136," No sympathy for this narrator: I agree with much of what Abby said, below. This book is very disappointing. If you are expecting a fun, witty Helen Fielding-style book, you're going to be disappointed.Tessaro breaks a most basic rule of writing by telling the reader how the main characters are feeling rather than showing it. It feels forced. But the main problem I have with this book is that the main character, Louise, is very unappealing. She comes across as selfish and shallow and self-obsessed. Tessaro obviously wants us to think ""you go, girl!"" when Louise tells us about flirting openly with her husbands' colleagues; instead, I marvelled at how I was supposed to like a character who did these kinds of pathetic things. Finally, the whole premise of the book is weak - that by wearing tight clothes and putting on makeup, you can transform your life. Louise may become more physically attractive, but that doesn't change the fact that her character, like this book, leaves much to be desired.",__label__1

It works with almost all Flight Sims (including Microsoft's FSX and X-Plane)Cons: It seems to be cheaply made, thin plastics. It doesn't mount well to most desks and tables that I have tried it on.The BIG disadvantage that I cannot stand is in the pitch axis. It's impossible to return it to neutral! This is due to the springs not always placing the yoke back to it centered point.I do NOT recommend this yoke to any REAL pilots; it will frustrate you to no end.

The book covers all aspects of prostate cancer - from diagnosis to living with the results of treatment. It deals with the medical terms and emotional effects of each stage in a down to earth manner. I also really valued the fact that it was written to me - the woman. It made me feel understood in a way that much of literature doesn't as it all male orientated.

Tried a number of kitchen cleaners and they're still sticky. Can't say how well this works / how easy to remove on other surfaces, but for countertops, it was no good for my cat. If you still want to give it a try (cats are pretty different when it comes to this kind of thing) I would suggest covering the counters with tin foil first and putting the strips on the tin foil.

With all of the great production there is little room for Ross to mess up in the lyrical department but somehow he found a way to do so. There aren't any catchy hooks and definitely no thought provoking lyrics. Rick literally talks about the same exact things in every single song. Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse it does when Rick has to use the lyrics from his hooks just to end his verses. You can't feel any heart from Rick Ross in this album. There aren't any songs about his life at all; it's really just him bragging the entire album.

Angelina is hugely disappointing as one may expect but John Malkovich? Clearly the director has failed. The screenplay is a whole disappointment unto itself and not just because its predictable in a school play sort of way. If the Academy had to award bad performances, this movie would sweep a dozen.

With little effort she demonstrates both the heartbreak and the strength of a mother whose nine year old son disappears. What I also found interesting was director Clint Eastwood showing his versatility by helming a film with a strong female at it's center. The look of the film is also impressive with it's impeccable period art direction and costume design. The film I realize is based on a true story so I can't really testify to it's accuracy. That said, it smacked a little bit like warmed over James Ellroy. Also, the depiction of the film's villains, in this case the L.A.P.D., was a little heavy-handed and one-dimensional.

However, if you enjoy listening to introductions to clips of nostalgic music and comedy routines then you might want to give this a try. I found that the subject matter had little to do with self-esteem directly but more to do with announcing the next ""ditty"" ranging from Mae West to Al Jolson and Groucho Marx.

Yep: I cannot help you by pointing to one or the other as being better in any way. Williams is very direct and tackles each piece effortlessly, and in particular executes the tambora technique better than Russell, (or at least, it's recorded better). Russell meanwhile (as many point out) has a peculiar ability to inject more mood and/or feeling into a given piece - not just the (boring) drama of slower numbers either, but also the excitement and energy of faster numbers. Because of this it's really well worth your while to pick up EVERYTHING Russell has recorded: I've yet to encounter something I didn't like a LOT.I particularly enjoy the Danza Paraguaya tunes featured here, but prefer Williams for Cueca, and for his inclusion of Maxixa and Aconquija... in short: you've got to get both to fully appreciate the genius of Barrios!",__label__2 
234276," Does its Job: I bought this thermometer because my refrigerator seems to have zones where food freezes and zones where food is just cold. I also out it in the freezer to test the temperature. One of the benefits of using this thermometer is that you now know how much to adjust your thermostat up or down. This helps save electricity by not needing to cool the food down as much (This is not a manufacturer claim...It is my own).My only concern with this that I'll open the freezer door, and the temperatire will be ""X degrees"" and then I'll check later and it has swung up or down by 10 degrees. I do not know if this is the Heisenburg Uncertaintly Principle in action (because I opened the door to make an observation), or if its the rush of warm air from opening the door causing the change.Either way, this thermometer seems to work well enough.",__label__2

Not when the victim of the murder is killed in the last 5 minutes of the movie. What you do get with this is about an hour and a half of nonesense, lacking any sort of structure or climax. The script is horrible, and wastes the talents of many of the cast. While the cast members do try to put up a good act, it can't give life to a script that is obviously without structure. When I rented this movie, it was brand new and there was only one copy at a rather large Blockbuster. There's reason for that. In fact, I don't think even the one should have been there.

However, my favorite cuts are ""Boys Keep Swinging"" and ""Look Back in Anger."" The latter has a fascinating video (Bowie was a video pioneer) showing Bowie as a painter in reverse ""Dorian Gray"" scenario -- whatever happens to the painting happens to Bowie. Two rarely mentioned tracks, ""Red Sails"" and ""Yassasin"" (Turkish for ""long life"") are superior in many ways to ""Fashion.""

At 5 minutes and 2 seconds into DIDO a really spacey sound is faint or intentionally faded out on DIDO which really sounds awesome but too much of the recording doesn't emphasize the dreamy, spacey sounds of this recording which no doubt are there because this was made in Zurich but these sounds are faded out to emphasize the r&b; components instead.Great recording nonetheless there is less of the pure pop sound of the hits from his releases in 1984 and 1985 and on this 1987 release Bowie returns to more strange sounding music here mixed with 1980s pop.",__label__2

One night, out of the blue, I had a severe panic attack. I believe it to be caused by the SlimQuick Extreme so I stopped taking it immediately and all symptoms went away. Then my weight ballooned by 10 lbs. over the next month. My eating habits were very normal and healthy (vegetarian, tons of vegetables and fruit, almost no fat) but Slimquick destroyed my metabolism.

You get items you need somewhat esily at the very early stages of the game, so it's a definite must for RPG fans out there. It has been my favorite game so far on the PSP.",__label__2 
234346," Very light and mellow: I was told of Donavon through a friend of mine who, like me, was a fan of Jack Johnson's. It is well known that both Johnson and Frankenreiter are buddies, and as a result, their music sounds relatively similar.This disc, top to bottom, exudes a laid-back vibe, with soft, but catchy beats to complement Frankenreiter's smooth voice. When I listen to this album, images of a late Spring Saturday morning flood my mind. There seems to be an underlying feeling of just wanting to hang out and soak in whatever atmosphere the listener is in.The reason I gave it 4 stars is because of a relative lack of variety. He slows it down and picks it up, but unlike Jack Johnson, he doesn't vary his fast beats. This, however, is a very trivial matter and anyone who reads this review should get this album. It's a very easy listen and will definitely draw the listener in.",__label__2

They were spent enduring Donovan Frankenreiter's 1st attempt at making an album. Further proof that surfers should stick to what they do best--SURFING--and leave making records to musicians. If anyone can give me a single good reason for this album to exist, I am all ears. It is beyond bad, his songs are what Jack Johnson would've been writing in junior high school, only more boring.",__label__1

234350," The ultimate sin - it's boring: Purporting to be a hot romance, bordering on erotica, this novel (I am being generous in using this term) lacks understandable motivation, characterization, atmosphere, believability, and historical accuracy. And it's badly written, as well. The heroine (?) is accused of poisoning a man. By pouring the contents of a ""vile"" in his wine glass. Once is a typo. Repeated use of the wrong words (this is but one example) is simply lack of editorial control. Not surprising that it appears to be self-published - no self-respecting publisher would have accepted this drivel for publication. The one star rating is just to avoid it being unrated. I strongly recommend that lovers of historical romance, historical erotica, and good writing avoid this book.",__label__1

Although 5 stars seems a little extreme I do not feel 4 stars does justice to the album. CL smooth provides solid lyrics that Pete Rock would miss in his future albums. As far as Pete Rock. Anyone who knows real hip hip understands what this cat brings to the table. His beats are make me nod my head through the whole album. His instrumental interludes also give the album a great flow.

234374," No Justice for Miss Genovese: This book is slight in content as well as size. Essentially an essay on the Kitty Genovese case, the author tells us (twice) that he knew nothing of the woman other than her name, her age and the manner of her death. Those facts, along with a tiny bit of information about the killer and some anecdotes concerning the author's job at the New York Times and his contact with this story, are about all you get when you read this book. It's a pity that 35+ years after her death, the author knows no more about her or the case than he knew in 1964. His commentary is the easy commentary of a journalist who writes for quick deadlines, the cumulative effect of which is that, by book's end, we find that Miss Genovese' life and far-too-early violent death - witnessed by thirty-eight bystanders who failed to act - has been marginalized once more by an reporter who, himself, fails to investigate.",__label__1

234378," Fan's Favorite: It was refreshing when this album came out, the boys hadn't had a decent album in years and many were wondering whether they had lost their touch. John Henry combines the best of TMBG's twisted reality and forever-interpreted lyrics and adds to the mixing pot a good dose of first-class musicianship. Let's admit it people, the Johns aren't exactly Mozarts. One of the things that makes this albums so memorable is that many of the songs translate well to the new 'live band' format without leaving behind the drum-machine sensibility. For the fan who doesn't like their new retro-punk sound but who may not be ready for the mind-bending experiences of the early years, John Henry is a good recent example of the best of TMBG's work.",__label__2

They are 180 degrees different: delightfully light-hearted and free-spirited. They are so delicate that, except for the technique, you wouldn't think they sprung from the agitated mind of Beethoven. The lovely, but ubiquitous, Fur Elise is not among this set. That's fine with me, but if you like the playful, tender style of Fur Elise, then the 26 pieces found here will be right up your alley. Telarc has always been exceptional when capturing the piano on disc. O'conor's light touch gives the bagatelles the appropriate weight and he breezes through them like the wind through the leaves. This collection is one of my favorite piano recordings. Rather like champagne bubbles, these pieces gently tickle your senses.",__label__2

The bottom line? After 16 hours of trying, multiple visits to the LinkSys website, multiple converasations with their tech support, installing new drivers, installing new firmware, attempting to reinstall it more than 10 times, I gave up. Reinstalled my old stuff and sent this thing back. The most aggravating part was tech support. All I got was ""you need new drivers"" even though the stuff was BRAND NEW.

It didn't even work in the hallway to the office room. I had to return the card, but kept the router. I'm still looking for a card replacement.

The driver didn't cause any problem on his system but he had other problems. For one the card would not find or connect to the access point if it's right next to it!!

It has hints of punk and emo but also a hardcore feel with it's speed and breakdowns that you can not want to just dance to. An amazing record and it is sad to see the band has made such a huge departure from this work. Not to say that Through Being Cool and Stay What You Are are bad but they just do not posses the same hardcore youthful energy of Can't SlowDown with it's song for every occasion that will be stuck in your head everyday.,__label__2

It's difficult to find the inspiration in the art or narrative provided by the couple. Although it must be time consuming to craft so many stiches into a small space, it can also be said Mozart crammed many notes into a measure. While Mozart's music can be appreciated on many levels by many people, the artistic quality of Materson's work does not appear to have widespread interest among anyone who cannot relate to being an addict.

However, I believe it's at the cost of the symphonic grandeur that the best ""conventional"" conductors (e.g. Walter, Klemperer, Szell and, not least Bernstein/Sony) are able to achieve.

Just as fast and WAY better taste. I buy fresh herbs and freeze them in water in ice cube trays, then store the ice cubes in labeled ziplock bags in freezer, and always have fresh herbs available when I need them.

The album is a lot of hype with very little payoff. I was most excited about The Damning Well's cut, with its incredible potential, but it turns out to be nothing special at all. In fact, it seems as if the song forced Richard Patrick and Wes Borland to go through some kind of talent ""Filter"" (ha-ha), and removed whatever makes these musicians cool. The only halfway decent track is the new song from Skinny Puppy, but this doesn't come close to making up for the rest of the mediocre [stuff] on this album.I don't normally take the time to write music reviews, but if I can save just one person from making the same mistake I did, then it will have been worth it.Two words - It's [weak].",__label__1

I can't even get to the Knowledge Base that was so helpful with earlier versions. At least when you had problems with the earlier versions you could find a well written document with a useful work-around or solution. We had used ACT! since the two floppy disk version (our first laptop had no hard drive) and loved it through the upgrade to version 6. Were it not for the loss of data since the conversion I would go back right now to the older version, and we may have to do that anyway.

A class-action suit should be in the works for the damages these products are causing.Act! 2006 and 2007 will not only cause you hours of trouble with installation and data conversion, but will do plenty of damage to your Windows installation (registry entries, processes loaded on startup, etc.).Sage deserves to go out of business on these.",__label__1

Our outside IT consultants called this solution ""insane"" and advised against it.In the end, we had to remove the upgrades and revert to the previous ACT version (add another fun experience with Sage's Tech Support...).Sage agreed to take the software back (shipping cost - ours) and issue a full refund in ""about 4 to 6 weeks after receipt"", which is considerably longer than the one day it took them to charge my credit card.My advice - do not buy it.

Toward the last part of the book, even the final tragedy feels forced.

A book does not need to be intensely musical, but the opera itself is rather neglected. The story can be made to fit into the Jungian paradigm, but only by a very selective reading of the poetry, which neglects the richness of the Ring. If you have to go Jungian, go with Donington. Better yet, go with Deryck Cooke for an introduction.",__label__1 
234480, Old fashioned ideas: I read through half of this book and couldn't finish it. The title and the theory around the title was the most interesting paragraph in the whole book.

234481," Lacks research: This book should have been named 'Bill and Pam Farrel's guide to marriage', because that is what it essentially is - just Bill and Pam sharing what they do in their marriages, and giving themselves lots of pats on the back.The tips and techniques they offer lack research, there is insufficient representation of what other couples think and do, and the advice given is sometimes overly naive in today's culture where couples are exposed to sexual encounters and relationship issues way before marriage.For women looking for more practical advice supported by good research, I recommend For Women Only by Shaunti Feldhahn.",__label__1

Continuing in the same educational vein as Spirits of a Feather, but with a more literary bend, we are presented with the continuing saga of Jay. As Jay tries to establish himself in the adult world, he must come to terms with his values and his aboriginal roots. He also deals with the hostile and manipulative father of his girlfriend, and continues his quest for his own father.If you have ever been curious about various religious philosophies, Souls of a Feather may give you some insight. Souls of a Feather will lift some readers out of their homogeneous worlds and show them how varied life really is. Again, this book would make an excellent reader for high school students.Laura Davis (Professional writer and Reviewer)",__label__2

It is important that Scroge has given up family in favor of money, and by cutting these scenes, we're left with a more generalized (and therefore less personal or intense) notion of social responsibility.

234501," Returned it to the store it was so bad: I bought this title because I wanted my two children to practice writing their letters correctly. However we could never get the lines to correspond to where the pencil was. In order to trace a letter you had to actually draw the line an inch inside the line you were supposed to trace. Two calls to the company couldn't solve this problem and since we didn't have any problems with any other leapster software we were sure the calibration was right. This was very frustrating for my children especially because Mr. pencil cuts you off and makes you do it over if you go out of the line at all. There is no margin for error, very bad for kids just learning.We have 5 other Leapfrog cartridges and we love using the leapster but Mr. Pencil is a DUD.",__label__1

This is bad,really really bad! It's to the point where you can't even sit and listen to it..it's impossible! There's 22 tracks in all, and ""Memphis in June"" is about the only thing that saves this disc. The other tracks have nothing musical to speak of. My guess would be the only reason Ginnie Powell even sang with this outfit was becasue she was married to the leader. I'm sorry to say I enjoyed Johnny Bothwell CD, because he was the big star of this organization but the two never meet..I mean in the sense of the styles, Johnny played a lot like Hodges and was a little more relaxed and not so over the top like Raeburns' group.

I saw her live on the Lilith Fair and found her uninteresting, even annoying. And she's sooo pretentious. I'm a big 10,000 Maniacs fan; leaving that band was an egotistical mistake for Natalie.

The good bands who did it were Rage Against The Machine, Faith No More, One Minute Silence, Anthrax, Body Count and, definitely, Orange 9mm. (Korn is a band that I somewhat like, but they are NOT rap metal.) Anyways, Orange 9mm mixes the rap metal styles of Faith No More with the post-hardcore tunage of Quicksand, so you know this is going to be good. ""High Speed Charger"" gets everything going and is one of my favorite tracks, along with the other tracks, but my favorite is ""Sacrifice"", with the kick ass bass line. A good thing about old-school rap metal and funk metal is that they have some of the best bassists. (Korn's bassist kicks ass too.) You need to buy this lost gem now!",__label__2

Another alternative is ""13 Steps to Mentalism"" available at most Magic stores that also sell books on magic tricks.However, I personally find that the pre-requisite for some mentalism knowledge is NOT a must.

The family is now forced to live together in close confines and old and new problems begin to come to the surface. This is a very difficult movie to review. The acting is amazing. Every single person does a fantastic job throughout. The story is a little overused but still is a great idea.

A Live One is where I got my start many moons ago, and such tracks as Bouncing Around The Room and You Enjoy Myself were some of the first Phish songs I ever heard. Lucky for me, I put off listening to the monster Tweezer on the second disc of this album, because if I had listened to that while I was just starting out, I probably would have never listened to Phish again. I've heard a lot of versions of Tweezer, even better ones from 1994, and to this day can't understand why that Tweezer is filed under ""highlights of 94'"". It's long, boring, and tedious to listen to. I would definitly suggest buying the album, as it contains one of the best versions of YEM I've ever heard, and very good versions of Harry Hood and The Squirming Coil, but I would suggest skipping over Tweezer.

Unlike Microsoft and many other computer product companies, Linksys will happily solve your technical problems on the phone free of charge even if the product is not new. My wife got a new computer. Her old one was the satellite in my system. I could not get her new one to receive the signal.

234580," Oscar at his best: Oscar Peterson is one of the giants of piano jazz, and this CD's seemingly effortless display of genius shows why. Peterson and his band improvise endlessly in their trademark style, which never fails to make me relax, sit back (usually while driving in my car) and just feel happy. Tracks are energetic but also laid-back, generous in length, never hurried, crafted but not staged, reliable but never predictable. The styles of the selections are varied, some more melodic, bordering on classical or popular, but every track blends seamlessly with the others and every track satisfies. I've heard dozens of Oscar Peterson discs, and this is my favorite--just a superior showcase for the master, at the peak of his skills.",__label__2

His films pull back the curtain on a side of the Philippines that most would not want the world to see.I remember watching a news story from the Philippines last year about police raiding a theater such as the one depicted in this story. The setting for the movie is an old movie house that has seen better days.The owner is on the verge of bankruptcy and the once large movie house (that is the setting for this story) is deteriorating. The only thing keeping the place open is the owner's ability to borrow money.The main customers are gays and call boys who use the theater for anonymous sexual rendevous.,__label__2

One end should be set at a small length to plug into a phone, while the earpiece end extends or retracts. Nope, not the way this one works.

There are many good piano players, a few great piano players and even fewer masters of the piano. Any style, any song, Paul Smith owns the piano! It's a shame more of his work is not available. He was so busy over the years providing solid back-up for the likes of Ella, Sammy Davis, Jr. and the like that he never seemed to develop a pop following of his own.

Two men, Andrea (Alessandro Calzo) and Jeff (Adam Neal Smith) meet following the death of a mutual friend. During a very short visit the two share reminiscences and their feelings about the man they both loved, and find comfort and solace from their grief in a blossoming friendship and possible romance. The key word here is understated. Not much action, lots of quiet talking, lingering shots of them sleeping or staring into space. Much too slow for some tastes, but a rewarding experience for those with more patience. The performances by Calzo and Smith are heartfelt. All in all, a very sweet movie.",__label__2

Anyone can play them, but none can create them in touch and timeing. There are similarities between Shearing's interpretation of ""Favorate Things"" and Ax's efforts at Beetoven's ""Emperors Concerto"" The timeing of the more quiet passages - the pauses - are remarkably similar. Shearing has no choice but to manouver his notes in perfect cadance, or his work would be undistingished. Yet his timeing defines the work as does the ""Emperor's"". Both works are relatively simple in melody. It is the rythem patterns that define their greatness. Ax plays from paper - Shearing from his heart.",__label__2

But perhaps more importantly, Chemical-Biological Defense is also a very cogent and unsparing analysis of U.S. chemical and biological warfare defense. Mr. Mauroni makes an excellent case for beefing up our Chemical Corps, and integrating more fully realistic CB defense doctrine. Describing the kind of materiel and training available before the outbreak of hostilities in 1990-1991, Mauroni provides us with a complete picture of U.S. CB defensive posture--then and now. Neither a Cassandra nor Pollyannish, Mauroni blends the right amount of detailed information and narrative to present his highly-informed analysis. From this very important book, we learn how fortunate the United States military was in not having been attacked with Iraqi CB weapons--and how critical it is to be much better prepared for unconventional warfare in future conflicts.",__label__2

Potassium 40 and Uranium 238 are found in igneous rock and carbon 14 in remains of once living things. Newer information gives the carbon 14 half life at 5,730 (+- 40 years).

With that having been said, consider me endeared. As with all other e albums, this one had to grow on me, but my previous habit of never knowing which was my favorite is gone. A hint to the vast change with this one is the average track time of almost 7m - about twice that of their previous albums You have to listen to the whole album to get its feel (except that I always skip 'Grace'), but personal favorite tracks are #s 3, 4, 7, and 11.",__label__2

I'm not a fan of country, and I hadn't really heard Emmy before that song. She sings with so much emotion that I had to hear more! And this CD, was my first purchase of her music, and I loved it all. My favorite remains ""Orphan Girl"" but I can't find a bad song on this whole CD.",__label__2

I haven't researched but I seriously doubt that ""asthma"" was diagnosed as such in the early nineteenth century, and was it really necessary to introduce the ailment? Not really.The whole style of the book is bad formula historical romance with awkward dialogue, and clumsy introductions of secondary characters,obviously added to get readers to buy sequels and prequels. If this is any indication of the author's typical writing style, I will not be reading Gaelen Foley again. How is this stuff published?",__label__1

This is probably one of my favorite Cd's by TMBG. It includes so many great songs. What's really good about it is that they have a full band backing up the John's. I think that a lot of the songs off this Cd could be considered classic TMBG songs. My favorites are ""The Bells are Ringing,"" ""Till my head falls off,"" and""Your own worst enemy.""",__label__2

But the thrill wears off quickly, and you're left with a stale, repetitive contrived book with only a few funny scenes. The language is overused, the plot is flat, the characters predictable. I kept reading thinking that it was going to get better but it doesn't. It evokes those fond memories of bikerides through the park, and spending all summer out with your friends, ending your nights with games of Freedom.

This was originally released in '71 under the title ""Guilty,"" & credited to Eric Burdon & blues singer Jimmy Witherspoon. The backing band on one track is War. It is a true collaborative effort by 'Spoon & Eric, who share & trade the vocals. As befits 'Spoon, it is pretty straight-ahead, no nonsense blues. Eric makes sure that the groove is more '70's than '40's, & 'Spoon keeps him honest.Although the cover versions of The Laws Must Change (John Mayall), Have Mercy Judge (Chuck Berry) and the blues chestnut Goin' Down Slow are solid (James Taylor's Steam Roller Blues fared poorly), the highlights are the originals by 'Spoon & Eric. Especially noteworthy is the gospel-tinged finale, The Time Has Come, complete with Rev. James Cleveland Choir.Eric Burdon has had a notoriously uneven career, ranging from inspired to insipid. This is great stuff.",__label__2

It also preys on the minds of people and makes them believe in horrible things. Never mind the fact that Nostradamus has hundreds of prophecies yet to be fulfilled (or so vague that they won't be) and others that have hundreds of interpretations. Forget the fact that Nostradamus even said that his ""prophecies"" go to sometime the 3000 year range. Let's all be pessimistic and read books that fortell about our coming doom.

I remember when the first Spenser movie came out, I was overjoyed, but I thought that the movies had a few too many dead spots, as if these stories were written for the one hour alotted for the television series, and not for a full length film. I did enjoy seeing Robert Urich, and it is hard to believe that I won't see him again in a new Spenser movie. As for Avery Brooks, what can I say, he was born to play ""Hawk"". I do recommend the movie collection because it is a great chance for all of us to get a taste of good television. We may never see it this good again. Unless of course, the Spenser series is released on video. I rate this collection with 4 stars, not five, because of the slower pace, but the dialogue was first rate, as well as the chemistry between Urich and Brooks. Enjoy!!",__label__2

234661," Not worth tracking down: Listening to this album reminds me of Pantera's ""Far beyond driven"": While there are no standout weak links, the whole album is similarly monotonous and a disappointing followup. Any individual song isn't too bad (though hardly memorable), but listening to the whole CD makes me lose recognition of which song is playing after 15 minutes or so. Anthrax can blame their record label all they like for the weak sales and image problem, but the band similarly seemed to be putting little effort into this release. The first couple of songs and the end song are fine, but that's the Far beyond Driven problem again. I'd say pretty much any other Anthrax release is better. Even the debut with that first singer, because at least the band had some edge on that showing.",__label__1

At one point the book got so boring I had to skip around and try to find something interesting, but I never did.

The book mainly describes her research with sharks at her laboratory and is not that action packed. Still, I would recommend this book, especially for fans of Eugenie Clark.",__label__2

However in order to support his wife and a newborn son he reluctantly accepts a job as high school music teacher on temporary basis.

He purchases an island, moves there with his wife and step son, and then publishes his daily notes concerning his moods, relationships (which are not always pleasant), and how he passes the time. He regularly motors to the mainland to buy food and do laundry. They grow nothing, except a failed attempt at sod (SOD?). He fires off a hundred or so shotgun shells, and kills two ducks. Most of the local food is provided by his mainland neighbors. I would have much rather read about their lives than his.

The best songs are Chris Issak's ""Graduation Day"", Pete Droge's ""Beautiful Girl"" and Satchel's ""Suffering"". And who doesn't love ""Beth"" and ""Sweet Caroline""? But they are missing a song that was played in the movie, I think it may be the Greg Khin band, and not remembering the name of the damn song has plagued me.

If choosing between the VHS or DVD, definitely go with the DVD! Not a masterpiece, but again, if you like Sinatra and/or Rodgers & Hart, it IS a masterpiece. Novak & Hayworth are great, too.

The book introduces several subtle fashion strategies you never would've noticed had you not read the book. Although it's short on color matching, it made up for it with concrete style directions.

This has gotta be a contender for one of the absolute most abysmal films of all time.

When my stomach wasn't churning at the gratuitous splatter and random creepiness, it was turning over from the stilted dialog and wooden delivery of the actors.The box cover copy cites David Lynch as an influence/comparison to this film. David Lynch is an artist, and his works are incomparable to this mess that would get you booted out of film school. This is a low-budget exploitation of gore and misogyny. The creator of this movie is simply a butcher--of women, and of celluloid.If you can actually sit through this nonsense with any kind of appreciation for it, I pity you.",__label__1

Drummond takes an interesting approach in in this biography on the life of Spurgeon by basing it around John Bunyan's Pilgrim Progress. Having read several biographies on Spurgeon in preparation to write a research paper on him this is by far my favorite on him, as the author engages Spurgeon. The author excels at setting Spurgeon in his time period and then explains what he believes and what he during his long ministry.

I had specific problems for which there were no answers in this book. It is not right for every baby. However, less intense, laid back children may respond to this well. I think you have to know your child and do what is right for them. I have had better success with more sensitive methods.",__label__1 
234791," Clearly written, very helpful: I had heard a lot about ""Ferberizing"" but did not really understand what it all meant. Reading his book was extremely helpful for me, and gave me the information I needed to make good choices for me and my baby. For instance, I worried about her short naps, but he explained that a baby who sleeps well at night may not need a long nap. What a relief! I found his suggestions for how to work on improving a child's sleeping habits very humane and reasonable. Worth a read, even if you decide this is not the approach for you or your family. I did a great deal of reading on this topic, and I certainly suggest Ferber as one book for a parent to pick up.",__label__2 
234792," Maybe I'll Try Again Later: We tried this method for a few nights and a few naps when our daughter turned three months old, but it just didn't work for us. Perhaps we didn't give it enough time, but we just couldn't take it. The first night we started at 8:45, and she cried until 3:30 in the morning--she threw up twice during the process and snubbed for hours after we gave up. The next night after four hours, I gave up again, knowing that she was stubborn and would go until 3:30 again if we'd allow it. At four months old we started the No Cry Sleep Solution with better results. After only a week she began sleeping for six hours before waking for a short nursing period, and she is napping in bed for up to two hours each time. She is being put down while asleep now, so maybe we'll try the Ferber method when we start putting her down awake. My friends rave about Ferber, I just didn't have the stomach to make her cry for hours on end.",__label__1

I enjoyed both the historical account as well as Downer's experience in the Geisha quarters. This book somewhat dispells the notion that Geisha are merely Japan's version of a high class ""call girl."" The Geisha are much more than that even though there is money in exchange for their companionship or entertainment. As a fast reader, this book did take me a long time to finish.

He did have me smirking with his views on education and ""intelligent design"", but I could tell his heart really wasn't in it. Not his best work; he's much more funny on C-SPAN.",__label__1

The author represents a large portion of our American population and, therefore, cannot be lightly dismissed. This is an important book to read at this difficult time in our nation's history. Conservatives will find this book absolutely inspiring and liberals may discover in it a marvelous opportunity to exercise their tolerance for diversity.

However, if you already agree with him, his book is not really accomplishing anything. If you are moderate, you will probably be too put off by some of his statements to be able to sift through the book and find the reasonable ideas. If you are liberal, you will probably throw the book across the room. Santorum basically insults and demeans people who do not agree with him, so if you are going into this book trying to get the other perspective, you will probably just be insulted.",__label__1

He frequently discusses the problems that many married couples experience, but fails to address the methods that a couple can use to overcome these challenges. Sproul also makes a lot of unsupported empirical statements about the problems you *will* have in your marriage.

You have to wait until the end of the book and that is why I didn't it.I was wondering what his earlier work was like... and now I know. I won't be reading his 1st book but I will be reading what he puts out next. If anything, this shows how much an author can grow over time. It says this book was put out in 2003.

So, McPhee's Oranges certainly resonated with me. He is one of the few authors of non-fiction who writes beautifully - even his lists are fantastic. Oranges shows in a succinct format the beauty and creativity possible in natural history writing, especially when nature is so entertwined with culture.

Now, I'm not obsessive about the music, I welcome and love reworks of originals. But this CD is painful to listen to. It is one thing to cover someone's songs and put your own spin on them (just look at Strange Little Girls for example) but this CD offers nothing original or even uniquely its own. All they are doing, ALL they offer is slower, more boring, whiney replicas of the originals. What bothers me is that the instrumentation is almost exactly the same as the originals and the vocalist does do anything ""new,"" she pretty much tries to sound as much like Tori as possible. I've heard more original reworkings of Tori Amos songs from Tori herself, and that's saying a lot for her.",__label__1

234864," A performance for the ages: Shamefully, I knew nothing of Edith Piaf's spectacular life before seeing this film. It is a fascinating tale of triumph and tragedy, of incredible talent and unavoidable madness. Marion Cotillard's performance is one of the great characterizations of all time. Forget the makeup (ok, it was great -- let's move on), she captured Edith's innocence, her longing, her triumph and her descent in an incredibly moving way.My wife is not a fan of subtitled movies, finding them a distraction. She voiced no such opposition to this gem. The director's use of flashback and forward was rather whimsical and that was a minor distraction, but in the end it works to great effect, adding to the rollercoaster feel of Edith's actual life.Highly recommended.",__label__2

234866," An astonishing performance of a unique life and times: Marion Cotillard did a masterful job in portraing Edith Piaf, the grand French singer. ""La vie en rose"" means Life in Pink, Piaf's signature song. She first popularized it in 1946.Piaf's life, like that of many greats, had an abundance of drama and conflict. Among the drama and conflict was her abandonment first by her mother and then twice by her father, her brief childhood blindness, her upbringing in a brothel, and on to the start of her career singing on Parisian streets for centimes.Of course, those already familiar with Piaf, know that she had an unusual voice. It was a voice that would draw you in and excite you. You couldn't ignore it.This movie has a lot of her music and original songs. It is action-packed and dramatic, full of romp and fun and tragedy.If you like Piaf or just her music or if you like a good drama of a fascinating life, you'll enjoy this film.",__label__2

It never succeeds in painting her life, which was full of drama, lost love, found hope, hardships, tears, and laughter. It bases it powers to mesmerize more on the make-up expertise lavished on Marion Cotillon than on Edith's life.

234894," Endlessly bored: I had read all of Jodi Picoult's book. When I got my Kindle for Christmas, I found this one and thought I had to read it as well. I couldn't get into this one at all. It takes forever to understand who the characters are and then once you find out what is going on, you don't like them. Unless you have an intense love for the song of the humpback whale, don't bother. The characters are very badly explained and the back and forth is exhausting. Jodi's other books are so well written and pull you in to the story immediately. As my friend just told me...don't read it...who is going to care. So I quit reading it about a quarter of the way through.",__label__1 
234895," Decent: Not her best, but not as bad as The Pact. I appreciated the fact that the ending was less extreme than My Sister's Keeper. Her lack of knowledge of San Diego was frustrating. The book was written around Dr. Jones obsession with whales. However, I don't understand why she didn't use the real world-renowned Scripps Institute of Oceanography. She seems to sprinkle locations and information about San Diego throughout the book, yet I always had the feeling she was gathering the information from the internet because she seemed unfamiliar with the area.",__label__1

234899," Mighty Good: As other reviewers said, this looks like a cheap little toy when it comes out of its box. BUT, it weighs almost nothing, it costs about $10 less than a Swiffer, it picks up dirt and other stuff my Swiffer won't, and it doesn't need pads constantly replaced. It even picks bits and pieces off my wall-to-wall carpet. This is the best purchase I've made in ages. The only negative is that it won't stand upright by itself or against a wall. That's a tiny drawback compared to its price and cleaning ability.",__label__2 
234900," It's terrific, just as I expected.: Though I am a fairly new fan of Porcupine Tree, I have managed to buy all of their commercial releases in a matter of months, and none of them have disappointed me yet. Neither did this one. This is a collection of singles from the Lightbulb Sun and Stupid Dream periods, so it doesn't really have the ebb and flow that's typical of a Porcupine Tree release, but then again, it's not really supposed to. I think it's very cool that the band released these songs all on one CD so that people would actually get a chance to hear them without having to hunt them down. However, if you have hunted down all these singles, you're still missing out if you don't buy Recordings, mainly because there is a full length version of Even Less, and a few other previously unreleased tracks on this CD that are quite good. I personally feel like I have a treasure here because I am finally able to hear all the singles that I can only read about on the internet.",__label__2 
234901," Worth about $20: We got this as a gift, and frankly, I assumed it was around $20 until I came across this listing. Barely worth $20 max! It was very tippy, the green foot rests came off constantly (not really sturdy enough), and the handle snapped off (no great loss since the angle/quality wasn't great for pushing anyway, but left an unwanted sharply jagged edge). I'm really not all that picky - I mostly only write reviews when I've fallen in love with a product. But when I saw this price I had to chime in. Don't see the high price and assume it's good. We don't usually have problems with kid products, but this one's really only a $15-20 value.",__label__1

I should have paid closer attention to the specs, but for the price I just assumed it to be a larger play version. This ship would be fine for about $30.00 but not for the current selling price of 149.00. Not sure why it is so high.",__label__1

For those who only know these views, his ideas may come as a shock; for those who with to think freely (outside what others say we must think), his ideas are a breath of fresh air. The style of the book is accessible for those unfamiliar with Baudrillardian ideas/concepts, and in fact could be a way in to understanding what he means when he speaks of ""simulation"".

234906," Now here's a white boy with S-O-U-L!!!: We bought the album based on hearing only one track on the radio(""I don't want to be""). It was definitely a great buy! Gavin DeGraw is one of the most talented musicians to come along in the last few years. His lyrics are real and meaningful - he performs them straight from the heart. The melodies are fresh and unique, he's got a fantastic original sound. We are fans for life!!!!",__label__2 
234907," Stripped!!: Gavin DeGraw is completely talented. There's no doubt about it. But alot of times I find myself wondering why many artists can't perform that well live. This is one artist that did not leave me scratching my head. He is amazing live, and for some reason that makes me respect his music even more. I think that his live performances are better the his recorded sounds. So if you want something a little more intimate, packed with talent, and Gavin alone with his magical fingers on ivory keys, I suggest you check out his new album, Chariot Stripped. It has all the same songs as the album Chariot and it's just as awesome.",__label__2 
234908," did somebody owe his Dad a favor?: Sorry people, this album is barely listenable. I got it based on the catchy single ""I Don't Wanna Be"" thinking it may have some merit or at least a couple more good tracks. Apparently I was sadly mistaken. On first listen I thought it really can't be this bad, can it? So I played it again, and a third time. It just got worse. The lyrics are inane - the only comparison I can draw is that he is the male version of Ashlee Simpson. It's kinda like a movie that looks great based on the trailers, only to find out that you've already seen all the good parts on the commercial. Do yourself a favor - DL the song (or God forbid, songs) you like, and spend your money on a real singer-songwriter like Jason Mraz or Ben Harper.",__label__1

Yes, I do seem to like all types of music, but it seems that I never am able to find an ENTIRE c.d. that is worth buying. However, this c.d. is full of unique songs, with an original edge. DeGraw sings in such a clear sound, that you feel as if you are sitting next to him by the piano, while he is performing. This c.d. is unlike anyone I have ever heard before, it is perfect to listen to when you are trying to relax, study, or simply listen to music.",__label__2

Already seen on Carson Daly's NBC show ""Last Call"" and featured on the WB's Pepsi Smash DeGraw is a force to be reckoned with. With catchy lyrics, and an incredible talent for the piano ""Chariot"" is a fun, and easy to relate to album that pulls you in on the first listen, and keeps you coming back for more. From the first track and single ""Follow Through"" to the very end of the CD there is absolutely no question that DeGraw is here to stay, and is a much needed, and refreshing change from the many singer/songwriters and their acoustic guitars that are currently flooding the charts.",__label__2 
234915," The start of something good . . .: Gavin DeGraw is going to be a household name. His debut album, Chariot, is filled with songs that ring with influences ranging from Elton John to Sam Cooke, with a little bit of Jeff Buckley thrown in for good measure. The songs will stay with you long after the first listen, and you will find yourself singing ""I don't want to be anything other than what I've been trying to be lately"" for days to come. His lyrics and musicianship are equally as strong. With this amount of talent, it is clear that this guy will be with us for the long haul.",__label__2

Finally the powers of Google and user groups came through and I found that I had to reset the cable modem since I had used it with a different router earlier. Since then I have had internet connectivity. But I have been dissatisfied with customer service and would not have minded paying more if that had meant better support.",__label__1

As I was also installing a cable modem for the first time, I did that first with no problems. Them following the Netgear simple instructions, I was up and running with the router in only a few minutes with my hard wired iMac with OSX.Next I plugged in my IBM T20 laptop. Here is where I thought I would have problems. But on starting up Windows 2000, it established the proper networking without me having to do anything at all. I could access the internet and establish my VPN with work.I've had no problems since installation and now I am going to put a Netgear MA401 wireless card into the laptop to see how that works out.",__label__2

My wireless needed some tweaking but works. I get awesome signal throughout my home. Do read the posts here on troubleshooting the Centrino WiFi as many users have problems and it does work but needs reconfig. I dont need it cause I dont run XP on my laptops.The firewall functionality is good enough. If you need a lot of access control or rulesets or a VPN gateway you will have to buy a much more expensive unit. Your best bet if you have more than one computer is buy this unit and then use a software based firewall the the more advanced rules. I can also confirm the VPN pass thru works good.

It was never anything but trouble the whole time I had it and once it started freezing and not being able to transfer music I took it back to Circuit City last weekend (March 11).At this point I have to give props to Circuit City. Their customer service person did not hesitate to give me a full refund without as much as a question. I walked to where the IPods were and found a 30gb IPod in an open box for $239.00.

I realise this is a serious movie, as Akbar is almost deified by some, but I was still disappointed.Hrithik also has a tendency to overact, although because this is a period piece it is almost appropriate that he does.Aish does her thing with pouty competence. Her outfits are truly glorious; she looks every inch the queen.The history is butchered, the acting is fine but not stellar, but I must admit it is nice to see this amount of money thrown at an Indian period piece.

This is all too enticing for each of the lead characters in ""Foreign Correspondences"". Director and writer Mark Tapio Kines explores the journey of two young individuals looking for love and acceptance only to have their pursuit complicated by their well-meant intentions going wrong. There are poignant performances by Melanie Lynskey and Corin Nemec as they portray characters that are both strong and completely fallible. Each of the stories are memorable and honest, you will be embrace by this sincere film.",__label__2 
296934," Screenplay for a Video game: I think Matthew Reilly might have wanted to model his work after Tom Clancy's success in turning books into video games, which is not a bad idea, but I think he jumped the gun and wanted to shoten timeframe by writing a video game screenplay and try to package into a book format. I loved all of Reilly's earlier books, although unbelievable adventures, they were rooted in reality, this book however tries to present video game type sequences where the gamers have to brave all odds to get to the prize, which doesnt work as a book. Totally disappointed in the book except for few scenes in Paris.",__label__1

I was expecting much of the same in The 7 Deadly Wonders, but I enjoy thrillers, and the premise was intriguing.I couldn't get past the first chapter. I couldn't FINISH the first chapter. I stuck it out through the innumerable booby traps, the soldiers, the heroic jump onto the bull croc and the stone killer Americans, all plentifully sprinkled with the afore-mentioned exclamation points and italics and decided I couldn't take any more.I have nothing against action novels written for fun, and I don't demand literary quality in everything I read. I believe in brain candy. But this book reads as if someone took a comic book and explained each panel at great and insulting length. Reilly shows a remarkable--and surprising--lack of respect for his readers.",__label__1

That point is certainly relevant but the problem is that Reilly is a lousy writer. Not only is characterization almost non existent, plotting weak and dialogue banal to the extreme, but reading Reilly's prose is like listening to fingernails on a chalkboard. And why is he so preoccupied with exclamation points??!!!!!!!!!!!!There are thriller/action/adventure writers who can write fairly well. Reilly is not one of them. Regardless as to what your literary tastes are, I can think of no reason to read Reilly.I picked up this book because of the Egyptology theme but Reilly's treatment of it is very weak.

The costume is small, the vest isn't but the costume itself is very small. I got my very slender 7 year old the 8-10 and it was snug and short. So beware and order big.

The workbook format is easily readable and leads the readers through each chapter, requiring them to complete various exercises in a meaningful way.

I liked that the husband really seemed to understand the mental multitasking women do, and I was really impressed that he imposed some manners and discipline on his child. He really is part male and part female. My only problem was that I felt he saw his daughter as a kind of project to be done correctly. I never got the feeling that he loved her for who she was.

They are of different religions, at odds with one another, and their parents don't approve and barely does the community. Although the main plot is somewhat predictable as a Romeo-Juliet type love story, the setting of the time, location and politics is not so predictable and makes for an interesting new twist on the genre.

But to assert that the screenwriter is the real ""author"" of a film suggests an enormous naivete. So here again is a book written by someone who has never been involved in making a movie; doesn't know the multiple contributions that include the writer, the actors, the directors, the makeup man, the music director, etc. Good writing can justify an unsound book.

Directors such as Alfred Hitchcok, John Ford and Howard Hawks certainly left strong signatures on their product, returning to similar themes and using recurring images and background music across several decades. It would be difficult to say the same of the writers Kipen briefly reviews in the back of the book, especially when many of the screenplays have little in common.

Most of us are hoping to avoid the hassle of replacing batteries once a year or to just have a sure way to get into your home without keys. But with this low quality design, (ovbiously a cash cow for Genie), it looks like you will have to replace the whole thing due to failure!

The author does an excellent job of not only articulating the nuts of bolts of a great screenplay but also gives practical information on how to do it. This is something many others do not explain.

I thought this device might help me with the job of bagging the needles. Alas, it did not. The needles are in a mat prior to raking that is impervious to the vacuum, so I couldn't simply vacuum them into bags. After being raked into piles the needles must be hand-fed into the vacuum, which is more work and less efficient than just bagging them. I rate the device 1 star for my application, but added a star because it's very well made and I'll probably find other uses for it.On the positive side, I purchased the Toro 29210 43-Gallon Gardening Spring Bucket along with this and it really helps me bag the needles.

Using this product the blower/vac is connected to a large pail via a relatively short hose, therefore the there is some jostling of the pail.

He tries to become an artist because he wants to ""do something beautiful"" with his life--he also believes it's his only way to succeed.Naive and friendly, he wins affection and contempt along the way. The outcome I'll leave for you to find, along with the love story in the play, but I will say this: Jimmy Shine is an everyday hero, like Willy Loman in ""Death of a Salesman"".He is haunted and depressed by not being able to do what he believes he needs to do--he thinks about suicide, but not seriously.Unlike Willy Loman, he makes a decision in the end that isn't nearly so definitively tragic--it's more of a new beginning.This is worth reading, for any artist, musician, or actor, or any person who has wanted to do something beautiful or successful, only to run into obstacles.

297063, Highly recommend: I've been a huge devotee of the Sidekick since Tmobile first came out with the first one in early 2003...so i've been a subscriber for the past 3 years. I have probably spent 2-3 hrs each day with the Sidekick II for the past 1.5 yrs and rarely have i encountered problems with it. The newly updated software that allows Java-script runs into some problems...because of its low 32mb RAM and 16 Rom memory. Other than that i've convinced my entire family to own this thing- and can't wait until the Sidekick III debuts.,__label__2 
297064," Sidekick is too cool. T-Mobile stinks: As you will note from the other reviews, T-Mobile is awful. And in all liklihood no one there is smart enough or cares enough to read reviews of their service. Don't even try to make a call from a basement. Signal strength is non-existent. We called to cancel and they said, ""We'll give you the web server free for a month to try."" We cancelled within the month and they charged us anyway. Nothing we could say would make them rescind the charge. How do they stay in business?",__label__1 
297065," Dont buy: One star is way too high. Your contacts, email, phone numbers stay on the service not the phone (actually a company called Danger runs the service for all the SK2 aka Hiptop2 carriers). Before buying look around the net at how many times the service is unavailable (we're talking days not minutes here) and what that means when you can't use your email/IM/web from the phone OR get to your information. Then ask about a Service Level Agreement before purchasing - when the carrier stops laughing you might get the feeling that this is not the best purchase if its going to be the only phone you carry.",__label__1 
297066," not worth the trouble: I purchased the phone at an amazingly low price with all of the rebates ([...])! It's definitely different from any other phone I've owned in the past. The swivel screan was my favorite feature however, in the first week of using the phone, the screan broke right off. I took it to T-Mobile and they replaced it. Another week later, the keyboard cracked. Then, the screan cracked. I always carried the phone in the leather case in my pocket or purse. I've never had a phone that fragile before. I was at T-Mobile about 3 times a week with problem after problem, from equipment malfunctions to service issues. After two-months of nothing but trouble, I paid the [...] cancellation fee (the amount I saved in rebates) and threw the phone out. It just wasn't worth the trouble.",__label__1 
297067," a little too ""user friendly"": Although the Sidekick II is easy to use, with an ergonomic, compact qwerty keyboard, if you are at all technically savvy you will find this PDA phone much less versatile than many ""ordinary"" satellite/internet phones.Only a few ringtones can be stored, and they must be purchased from a limited choice offered by t-mobile. The camera takes good pictures but they cannot be used as a display background. Java is not available. You can send .wav and jpeg files to the phone via email but they cannot be saved. The display decor seems rather Barbie-dollish and juvenile.At first I was excited about the Sidekick II but after encountering its annoying limitations, I soon lost my enthusiasm. If you want to customize your phone at all, this is not the device for you.",__label__1

First time used, a wooden child safety barrier gate (with no sharp edges, and no stretching of the bag to accomodate it) had worn a 6 inch hole thru the rear of the bag in less than 200 miles travel. The only other things being carried were a couple of foam ""boogie boards"" and several beach toys and floats.I wouldn't use this bag for anything more than soft clothing - the material is not as robust as winter jacket shell cloth - and nothing like the ballistic nylon that suitcases are made of.Update: Thule wouldn't honor their ""lifetime"" warranty (product less than 2 months old) which was disappointing but Amazon gave me a full refund.

They come with easy to follow directions including washing them upon arrival, refrigerate and release at dusk. We released them three days ago. While I don't actively see many of the ladybugs now (most I assume headed for the tree where I think most of them were), there is a huge reduction in the number of aphids in the yard to the point that my husband was able to sit outside and enjoy the yard for a few hours yesterday.

This game fully utilizes the Xbox's potential as a graphical powerhouse.

Second, there is no option to just roam around the city, which I would have loved. And third, the game is too short, with only 30 missions, most of which are fairly easy to beat.

The songs include the well-known ""Why Was I Born?"" and ""Don't Ever Leave Me,"" but for me, the highlight is the lesser-known gem ""Here Am I."" Sadly, the print of the movie is not in the best shape (lots of nicks and scratches), depriving us of a full appreciation of what looks like some really stunning black-and-white photography.

And it is tough work, hard to read about, even harder if you come from a family with a history of addiction and abuse and have someone important in your life dealing with similar problems. It's also tough reading about a professional having trouble fostering trust and waiting for someone to ""get it"" and stick with treatment when they have only the slimmest chance of survival without it. Luckily, it's well-written, breezy, and will only take a couple evenings to finish.

The games are the good old games we older generation grew up with, but the playability with the XBOX controller is not intuitive and so sensitive that the games are unplayable. Complete illogical buttons are assigned to fire thrusters and navigation. The Ping-Pong and Breakout games as an example are unplayable because the controller is so sensitive that the smallest joystick movement is translated to such a large movement that there isn't a way of attaining accuracy of hitting the ball.I would like to warn users that this will be the biggest waste of money you have thrown out if you purchase this game.

The plot is almost non-existent, which while I enjoy sometimes is not pulled off particularly well here. Nothing is resolved, and nothing really 'happens'. The protaganist is almost characterless, as is his female companion, and they essentially wander through the book in the only direction they can waiting for things to happen.Robinson is obviously a nature lover and this is the strongest element of the story.

Unlike most series that have large amounts of violance, the usage of less notable characters as battle fodder is greatly reduced, with each death being final and complete, making you almost wish the series would bring the characters back, you love or hate them that much. But thankfully the series doesn't, which allows it to keep up the atmosphere that you never know who goes next. The series' end is tragic and heartfelt, making you feel that it is both sad but necessary. A truly great series, I would recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in Anime or Ninja.",__label__2

I have been doing Yoga for 4 years and as a fitness instructor/personal trainer I am pretty confidant in the poses and breath involved. I could barely keep up with her transitions back and forth between moves she went so fast. You had no time to actually get into a pose before she was on to the next. Yoga is holding a pose for at least a few seconds before moving, this definetly does not qualify.As with other reviews I to had a hard time seeing what she was doing and she very rarely named the pose you were moving into or cued it. I'll have to watch again, but I think she actually miss named one or two poses when she did name them.Maybe Denise needs to stick with the cardio workouts where she is truly great.",__label__1

There is one fairly good action sequence at the halfway point as well as a neat stunt that sees him jumping down a building via the air conditioning units, but you definitely get the feeling that Chan's no longer pushing himself but is just doing what he knows he can still do while Yuen Biao is mostly wasted in a nothing bit part. He's made worse, but that's hardly a recommendation.Dragon Dynasty's 2-disc set offers the theatrical version with audio commentary.

It just doesn't get down to true behavior changes that can only occur from exposure and response prevention therapy.

As a superbly organized and presented study of the many varying intricacies of the Jewish life, Gateway To Judaism focuses upon the modern Jewry, relating him to the jews of ancient or earlier times, and cogently investigates the acceptable new traits, practices etc, as well as defines the line to be drawn when exploring your own practices.

It is not the run of the mill western because it deals with horrific, freqeunt betrayal and the relentless search by Rafe to clear his name. Watching him evolve from this driven man whose only emotion is hate and revenge into a man who learns that revenge isn't all he thought it would be is excellent. The fact that he is helped in this soul changing experience by the love of his enemy's daughter is also excellent. Shea also must choose between the man she loves and the father she never knew she had.Add to that great characters and incredibly dedicated male friendships that stand by Rafe throughout his ordeal and sacrifice their lives to help him and you have a really wonderful book. It's so much more than a romance. The male bonding in itself is very unique and heartrending. Pat Potter's books are rarely disappointing and this one wasn't either.",__label__2

I might be allergic to the metal but I currently have two welts on me from the clip.My other complaint about this player is that if you want the songs to play in a particular order, you have to remove all the songs first. If you delete some songs and transfer some new ones, they will fill in the gaps and therefore be out of order.

297333," A blast from the past: Kindred is an amazing story that transports readers along with Dana, from the freedom of 1976 to a horrid time - slavery. Since the trips precede her birth and ours, Dana experiences culture shock but learns to survive in the 19th century.Although the trips from sunny California to the muddy south are very painful, Dana grows wiser and stronger with each visit. She is summoned to help a slave-owner's son who later becomes the seed responsible for her existence.The author weaves a tale that compels readers to undertake a horrible, mysterious journey into slavery. Though the past is as ugly up close as described by our ancestors, we pack our curiosity and determination and travel with Dana.

I usually steer clear of science-fiction novels, but Kindred is different in that it has to do with history; it was real at one time. It is about a African-American writer, Dana, who is forced to go back in time to save an ancestor in the pre-civil war south. Twists occur when her white husband travels back with her. She is forced to live a house slave's life; she is forced to think of whites as better than herself. It is interesting to watch how she goes from ""acting"" her part to really being accustomed to living as a servant. She does, however, hold on to some of her exisiting convictions. She is compelled to stand up for beliefs and well as others' well beings. There are many challenges that she has to face, and she conquers many them.

BUT, it is a disgrace that the editor of this anthalogy let so many typos in! I read only about 20 of the poems to my son and found 3 of them had typos! A wrong word in a poem really screws up the poem. Alfred Lord Tennyson's the Eagle is now ""he clasps the crag with crooked hands, close to the sun in lonely HANDS"" (instead of lands).There were several others like that, and I shut the book. Lucky for us it was from the library. If they ever print a new edition utilizing a better editor, I would love to buy this book.",__label__1 
297398," Good value and enjoyable: I got this as a present for my 4 year-old who is in ballet lessons. She loves ballet and really wanted this. It's very much geared to a younger child, with the music and dance. It progresses from a dance studio to the ""finale"" on a real stage. This provides a nice change of pace. The production is high quality and very professional.I liked the lead dancer, she's very appealing for a young child to watch. The barre is nice for support, it's not intended to be anything more than that. The point is for the children to learn how to dance without the barre. It leads them through a variety of steps and sequences and then at the end it's all put together into a scene from Swan Lake. I think the pace is just right. It's assumed that this will be watched several times. The teaching is done through demonstration, not through detailed explanation.Our set contained two dvds and mats, one for Swan Lake and one for the Lets Go Dance introductory dvd.",__label__2

It appears from other reviews that people were bagging this simply because they failed to understand it. Kafka isn't supposed to be accessable. He is dense, sophisticated and surreal. He is also riotously funny, although many miss his humour. As for the end of The Trial (which is, in my humble opinion, the greatest novel written this century, and probably never could be done justice by a film), you are not supposed to understand what was going on (K didn't either! ). That is the whole point. The Trial is, amongst many other things, a scathing examination of the meaninglessness of bureaucracy. I dare say if you persist with either the book or the film, but particularly the book, you will be greatly rewarded.All in all this is a very good, albeit not great, film.

Further to reading the reviews from this movie, neither do others...they are left just as confused. If not more so. And for those who claimed to have loved it and understood who were not able to say either what it was it was about... and so to them I say this is bull.

The rug appears not to be impervious to cat claws, but if it gets snagged from scratching, I'll hardly fault the rug for this.As for the size of the cars appropriate for the rug, I notice Matchbox cars work okay on the one-lane roads; two-lane roads are too tight, and parking spaces are out of the question (but most kids may not care). If you went with Micro Machines (or comparable) instead, they'd fit much better on the two-lane roads; the parking lots would still be a bit tight, but they'd fit.

What should be subtle and smooth just ends up sounding schmaltzy. I think that this vocalist must be a big fan of Bryan Ferry. This is certainly not a bad thing, but Bryan is a natural. This guy is an imitator. This is too bad because his vocal quality is actually quite unique in a good way. The arrangements are sloppy. The mix is amateurish. (Too much reverb on the vocal.)

It's new though, and definitely doesn't have any prongs. All it has is the little leather flab, which to me is quite disappointing. If you open the case to use your pda, there will be nothing holding the case to the pda. It'll just flap around even more than the original cover did (which at least had the prongs to hold the case in) and just be another annoying thing to carry while you're trying to use your pda.Anyways, that's a pretty big annoyance for me, but if you don't mind, then it's fine in every other respect.",__label__1

The camera often froze up after just 5 or 6 pictures with brand new batteries. I used 20 Energizer's to take about 300 pictures. Kodak was quite unsympathetic (when I contacted them upon returning home) and explained that lithium or NiMH re-chargeables were recommended. I returned the other camera. This camera comes with one rechargeable pack and a charger. One reason I bought another Kodak is because it is for my girlfriend and she already has the Kodak software on her laptop.,__label__2

The show has the feel of a religious service, with the Boss and his band, including wife/background singer Patti Scialfa and both Steve Van Zandt AND Nils Lofgren on guitars, testifying like nobody's business. It took a lot of guts for Springsteen to perform ""American Skin (41 Shots)"" in protest against police officers shooting an innocent person, but he pulled it off by hushing the whole audience.

With great lines such as ""Damn girl, what'd ya do in that bathroom?"", this film wastes its immense potential. Shannon Tweed shines in this quasi-hot flick as a homicide detective. Her fine supporting castmates do their best to bring nuance to their scandalously underdeveloped characters, but overall this film is only average. The biggest mistake in this film is wasting the fine potentiality of scenes in the stunning Maxim and Arizona Charlie's Hotels in Vegas.

I was disapointed to find that it's only an average read. The Ripper, evil as he is, is portrayed as no more than an English fop. The hero, Trevor, gives new meaning to the word fickle as he tromps from one adventure to another. The whole story seems disjointed. I found myself scanning a lot.

""The Language of Blood"" is highly imaginative, but may be difficult for younger children who are yet unable to slip their minds into another culture and time.

Subsequent to reading Life Mask, I was prompted to do my own research on the central characters...they were that interesting.Perhaps some people were put off by the lesbian story line? If you have no sympathy for the trials and tribulations in Anne Damer's love life, then yes, this book is not for you.

Oh, and yea, they have non-consumer friendly screws. You can't find a screwdriver that works on these little guys. Sort of like a star - with a upraised dot in the middle.Since this 12 cup is out-of-warranty, and I need an under-the-cabinet model, I bought the only other one that is made.

I truly believe that Chad Kroeger influenced this band way too much, and it wasnt a very good influence. All of their songs and discs are just not original, and are unflattering attempts at mimicking other bands styles, and fail. Like I always say, if you are going to try to be someone else, you better do it far better fashion than the original. Otherwise you are just wasting everyones time. I think the band COULD be something if they found their own direction, and let loose. But so far they havent. I give this 2 stars only for the one good song.",__label__1

As much as I would love to believe that I am burning close to 500 calories while doing 50 minutes of yoga, I just can't deal with it's gross inaccuracy. Very disappointed in Timex products.

It is a good budget HRM and pound for pound one of the best. My only knock on it is that when I was doing push ups, the top right button was pressed up against the back of my left hand and this caused to stop the chrono timer thus stopping the data collection for review purposes, just briefly however. Since I've taken notice of this and I've kept this in mind whenever doing push ups or any other hand bending exercise and so far it has worked out. Other than that, the strap both on the watch and the wireless heart rate monitor are comfortable and tough. Waterproof too. Performance alone I would give it a quick 5 stars(hrm is accurate, calories, ect), but overall it merits 4 stars in my personal case. I would highly recommend this product too.",__label__2

297537," Great idea but not a good fit: I read both the positive and negative reviews for this item before purchasing it, and felt that the good far outweighed the bad, so I tried it. Unfortunately, I found that the main fault mentioned in all the bad reviews applied to me - it is just too large for my hand. My hands are about average size for a woman, but this mouse really felt way too big. Also, I found that the keys required too strong of an effort to click (another problem mentioned in several negative reviews I read). For someone who is looking for relief from carpal tunnel, this was no better than a regular mouse and worse than some I've used with a lighter touch required. It really was disappointing to me because it seems like such a great idea - the vertical placement of the arm really did feel better than a regular mouse; maybe if it were offered in more than one size that would be great, but they would still need to adjust the touch on the keys for it to give any real relief.",__label__1

When you grip this device you fingers hover over the buttons and you have to apply slight, but constant pressure on you hand to avoid constantly pressing the buttons. I had to glue a plastic bridge across the device to be able to grip it with out constantly pressing the buttons. Unlike the 3m mouse-of which I highly recommend-using this thing leads to eventual pain. This is the same problem that plagues standard horizontal mice. It is OK for about 15 minutes but then you have to stop using it or you start getting the carpal tunnel issue. The best thing so far for this problem is the 3m mouse. The only problem with that one is the lack of extra buttons. I highly don't recommend this Evoluent mouse.",__label__1

The small ""lump"" bone on outer side of my wrist became very sore, as it was pressing/resting against the desk surface. Unlike the downward motion of left or right-clicking a standard mouse (with the table/desk surface creating resistance) there is no resistance when left or right-clicking and the mouse is always moving slightly when clicked... you have to constantly re-position it.

It's a welcome addition to my sizeable collection of guides to caring for dogs. Her advice has been most effective on a very difficult doberman pinscher that I recently adopted.

I thought this book looked like a good start. (I already have another, smaller, milder, gentler, female dog, and have trained her successfully). And I did find some good tips. But I was shocked by the author's suggestion to hit a dog with: 1. the flat of your hand. 2. a large children's book. 3. a ""jump-bat"" I thought those training methods went out with Descartes!

It appears that while the outside case appears strong and secure it has no flexibility and is brittle. So when it was dropped or thrown around by the airline....whatever occurred ...it shattered instead of flexed. Furthermore, when I brought the bag in for repair Delsey completely denied any responsibility and refused to replace or even try to fix it.

In this book, Bell's purpose is not to hit you upside the head with page after page of his own practical theology - it is to make you question yours.Bell's style is captivating and his words are thought provoking. By diging into the Jewish history behind scripture and challenging the church's attitude towards serving others, the reader will find ""Elvis"" hard to put down. Most importantly, the reader is encouraged to never stop testing and probing what they hear or read, including this book.

I have all the chapters in JDBC, XML , Web Services, Servlets which is not ""Just Java"".Also, I felt the OOPS concepts are explained difficultly.Simple concepts like Inheritance the author made it complex and used some Window or WarningWindow example which not only confusing but also readers wonder whether they have to read that before and come here.Concepts on 32 bit, 64 bit explanation.

297627, A Little Disappointed!: This book could have been better if the author would have spent more time on her two main characters and trying to get them together. What I really liked most about Eugenia was that she wasn't one of those great beauties that I usally read about but her fun-loving personality is what made her attractive. Sir Peter seemed a little weak to me I guess it's because he really didn't get his fair share of attention. I really don't see how they fell in love since they really didn't spend that much time together throughout the entire book. In my opinion I really think too much attention was being spent on the description of the scenery and other non-important character than on the main characters themselves. By the end of the book I got the feeling that it was written in a rush which is too bad because given a little more time on the two main characters (Eugenia and Sir Peter)it could have been a pretty good book.,__label__1

The characters are the ""scions"" of the previous two novels - and rather whiney characters at that. They spend their time lost in a jungle, afraid. The reader spends his or her time lost in the doldrums, bored. If one is an illustration flipper, like me, who tends to look at all the pictures before reading the plot, the ""magic eating creatures"" are already revealed. There are very few books that I cannot finish - this nearly became one of those (except that I had purchased it, I certainly would not have finished).

You don't need to make excuses to talk about your high school sweetheart; we were *hoping* you would.Anyway, the events of this book were not very exciting to me, but Vidal's explanation of himself is really something.

I found the book slow in places, yes; bitchy at times, a little; but I always went to work the next day feeling entertained and enlightened not only with the incredible intellect of Gore, but the glittering times, the fantastic people, and the odd political thinking of the author. Oh, and lest I forget; I dearly loved the underplayed yet prevailant descriptions of the sexual activity of the times and the exploits of some. What a treat.

He enjoyed the book and said that it has helped him understand how to say no and avoid the guilt he used to experience when doing so.Five stars - highly recommended!",__label__2 
297650," Quality item!: if you've ever bought a clip-on lamp, you probably learned these lessons:- if the clip is made of plastic, it will break. Don't buy these.- if the switch feels cheap, it probably is cheap, and will break. Avoid those.- you get what you pay for, a lot of these are under $20. They won't last.This lamp is more expensive than the ones you will find at Wal Mart or Target, but it is a far better product. The switch is sturdy; it actually feels good to turn it on and off, and that's saying something for a clip-on lamp. It looks classy. The clamp is metal. It's a winner.The spring in the clip could be a bit stronger. When clamped vertically it tends to slip. Otherwise perfect.",__label__2

The best is Mitch Moses' song Lonely Blues but there are so many great songs on this two CD set. i think there is only one song i don't care for and it isn't like i hate or anything. i highly recommend this CD as a good intro to Acid Jazz (which there ain't enough of in my opinion!)",__label__2

I have cruised several times and unless you are wealthy enough to book the top suite on the boat without a second thought, there is not much commanality to be had here.I would not reccommend it to first time cruisers unless they understand that most of the amenities mentioned in the first part of this book are not available to them. Examples being express pesonalized check in and preferred spa treatments. You will wait in long lines and staff will not be falling all over themselves to assist you. The way this cruise is described the crew was practically bowing and scraping every time these people asked for anything or even walked on a deck.Don't get me wrong. Crew members are generally polite and helpful, but not as eager to ask how high to jump as described herein.I will utilize the idea of taking our own coffee mugs, but that is all the help this book was to me.",__label__1

The book's major flaw is that it is too short.",__label__2

The orchestrations are trite and predictable. The rhymes are completely insipid and an absolute torture of the English language.

It is translated and summarized beautifully, with sentences such as these: ""Heaven begins in the meanest street, in the vilest house, when God's grace enters the soul of a man living there.""The very first sentence of MWOL will grab you.

297680," Steve Perry.......Top of his Class: I have always been a Journey fan, but in the beginning, they lacked the vocal style that was needed to become a Rock Arena Band. Steve Perry joined for their fourth album and immediately became one of the number one Rock Bands of all time. This CD covers his vocal technique with class. Steve can not only maintain his notes, but increase and decrease with ease. He is truly one of the vocalists that will last on and on. His voice is truly a gift from God. Not only can you hear him wail with ""If you need me, call me"", but also appreciate the soulful sounds of his ""Foolish Heart"", Oh, Sherrie, and more. Unfortunately, Steve is no longer with Journey, but you can be sure that he is still Rocking with us. Thanks Steve.",__label__2 
297681," Greatest Hits????: The number of glowing reviews for this CD is astounding to me. In a nostalgic mood, I started listening to the Journey box set, ""Time3"", then moved into Steve Perry first solo venture, ""Street Talk"". That should be the only Greatest Hits package available. This is pretty lousy. The tracks from the 1988 unreleased solo CD ""Against the Wall"" are pretty awful. There is a reason the record company did not release the CD, if they thought it was good and would sell, they would have released it. Where are the hooks??? Nothing memorable, lyrics of syrup and unimaginative music or arrangements. Only a couple of songs from ""Strange Medicine"" and that is a good thing. I am a Steve Perry fan, have all his stuff, including the CD singles that have some of the unreleased tracks on them, but, to be honest, the hooks haven't been there for awhile (including the reunion Journey CD) and the voice is thinning. There just isn't that much good here.",__label__1

The primary drawback is that the Triangle Nozzle is smaller and does not swivel like the old one did. This means that it does not sweep corners well and is very awkward to move across the floor. The cord is not convenient because you have to loop it and hang it up. There is no way to hang up the vacuum and it falls down easily. The one good feature is the dust container can be emptied and does not require a bag.I was so disgusted wuth the new vacuum that I have put it in the garage and am again using the old one!I also sent a letter to Royal Applaince Co.The next time I'll pay better attention to the reviews at Amazon - Thanks for posting them.,__label__1

I can't tell you how much has been lost. And, even if you didn't have all of the hard drive problems that seem to be common to the camera, I find the DVD loading mechanism unnecessarily tricky to load.

It is able to hold its true ethos right through the compilation, whilst attempting to bring of the blinkers and expose its listner to new sounds. Is'nt that really what music and compilations all about, education and expositionto music. If you want a straight house cd, grab the first two, but if you like variations to a groove, you cannot go past this one.Also check out the Standard Room Service cd's for some education in groove.",__label__2

297788," Best Computer I have ever owned!: I have never worked on a mac prior to purchasing my new iMac. I bought it primarily for converting home videos to dvd. I have attempted this on my pc and have failed miserably. Constant crashes and lockups. I have taken a chance on the iMac and boy am I impressed. I have, in a 4 days, created two dvd movies that play incredible on my big screen tv. This was just the begining. I receieve e-mail, fax, web browsing, quicken, ms office, mp3, the flat screen, ethernet port, 5 usb ports, 2 firewire ports, etc... The software is incredible and it runs beautifully.Also I am a web developer and creating java applications is awesome. I have now had my machine on for 3 straight weeks, it has only crashed once, when I put a program I wrote in an endless loop. I will never buy another windows based pc.

297789," Heavy rotation!: I made out like a bandit with this cd. Until recently, the label and the dj (Mauricio Aviles) were unknown to me. However, any cd featuring 'Atjazz' in the lineup has got to flow. If you like deep, smooth house then you will relate to this mix! It is mellow but the beats are strong. The remix version of MJ Cole's 'Sincere' is as wicked as they come! It is always nice to have a good source of deep house mixes. I trust that the Nude Dimension series won't disappoint the masses!**Watson**",__label__2

(Unlike most toys with all the wires and tape and such) - Got it for my 4 year old for Christmas. He hasn't played with it a whole bunch because he is really into his trio blocks right now, but it is really an impressive and well built toy. Very sturdy and very much ""just like the real thing."" Having it makes me want to buy less stuff but of better quality, if that makes any sense. I would use an analogy like Steak is to Hamburger like Bruder is to Tonka.

I have been making smoothies out of fruits and vegetables and never have I seen a blender do this good of a job in breaking carrots and grinding down strawberry seeds til you can't even tell that they're even there.

297806, Unless you eat off the ceiling avoid this blender: I assumed for the price and the Kitchen Aid brand that this would be well designed. Instead I found it useless with a basic design flaw. It starts up with such high torque that unless you hold the lid down with your hand the content blast out to every corner of the room. It does not matter what speed is selected since it always starts out with the same ulta blast.

I should have listened to what others had to say because within two months of use, the blade of the blender broke off while making a breakfast smoothie. KitchenAid offered to send a new one within a week or two, but I said no thanks. I can't afford not to have a functioning blender for a week -- I use it every morning to make my breakfast. I wanted my money back, and although KitchenAid said no, the Amazon employee complied and was very helpful.

297845," Great viewing for anyone interested in jazz: It's easy for anyone who has spent their life listening to and studying jazz music to point out the shortcomings of Ken Burns Jazz. I wholeheartedly agree with those who felt more than a few artists were trivialized, or just passed over (Metheny, Sun Ra, Joni Mitchell, Weather Report, Mel Lewis/Thad Jones, Lookout Farm, etc) But, I challenge anyone to do better.While there is an extensive focus on the sociology surrounding jazz (and dancing), these themes are important to the history of jazz. The sociological component is absolutely essential to the evolution of the various directions in jazz. If the documentary exclusively focused on the technological, thematic, and harmonic advances of the various artists, it would be more than a little dry for anyone who is not a musician.Kudos to Ken Burns for painting a great picture of the history of jazz.Shawn",__label__2

This 10 part mini-series attempts to do that and in some respects does, but jazz is just to big to get it all in.As some other reviews here have said, the later episodes become very disjointed. The last episode unfortunately tries to do too much. Having had those negative feelings though does not make this a bad series.Seeing the photo of the little boy in Jackson Square playing the trumpet in the last episode sums it up better than words ever could. This series, incomplete as it may be, is a chance for the music to gain a whole new group of followers.

But figured I might get lucky and save me about ten bucks. I use my drill about 3 times a year and just need the battery charged and ready to go when the time comes to use it. Product ordering and shipiing was a breeze (Bettervac). I plugged it into the wall and entire unit started to smell. I thought maybe it was just the new plastic and would stop. The smell continued and the unit began to melt. This was right out of the box. Now I'll buy the PS1MVC (originally my 1st choice) that has decent reviews. Complete waste of money and Black and Decker should recall all of these. They probably sold them off to vendors for a buck, instead throwing them in the dumpster.

The multichannel production is primarily stereo with center and rear channels providing ambient echo. I'm still learning about SACD and its differneces over CD (PCM) are subtle. Music (vocals in particular) are warmer and more realistic. The ""edge"" present in CD recordings seems softer. Details (subtle notes, whispers, etc) are heard more distinctly. Alison's fine voice and the instruments of Union Station really do the SACD format justice. Alison begans the track ""Down to the River"" acapella. With only her voice to be heard I realized how good SACD can be. Her singing on the track is simply the most realistic recording I have ever heard come through my speakers.

It was the first one that I had read by Ignatieff but I enjoyed it so much that I went on to read both his other ones.(The Needs of Strangers and The Warriors Code) This one is indeed a rare find.

The music is good and it does provide a ""Written song sheet"" to give you the words if you are ""Very Familiar"" with the songs provided.

This particular group is hard to find and that sort of makes one feel desperate to buy just anything offered to get the one or two songs you're looking for.

That's it. Nothing to fold out, no inserts or anything. I didn't care much for the printing of the art either, as it seems like the cheapest process was used, on a semi-gloss sort of surface - like magazines.The record is also only two sided.

The soul of the music lies in the margins, between the notes, and in the small variations.If you dont already own ""The Earth is Not a Cold Dead Place,"" I would recommend starting there, as it is the band's masterpiece. If you've already heard and loved that one, this record is the next logical step.",__label__2 
297929," Wolves--Endangered or Dangerous?: As a photographer and retired psychologist I am fascinated by human behavior and more recently attitudes about wolves. Over the last few years my husband and I have spent several weeks during the winter in Yellowstone. We began photographing wolves after noticing the numbers of wolf watchers who huddled with their scopes watching the animals. We began to understand their behavior and how the reintroduction to Yellowstone balanced the ecology. We also realized after our visits, how many people feared and/or hated wolves. Naturalist R.D. Lawrence addresses these issues in a thorough way, making a good case for the preservation of the wolf. His opinions reflect what we have experienced first-hand. He explains why the hybrids (wolves bred with dogs or coyotes) have given wolves a bad name. Agree with it or not it? I do--It should be read.",__label__2

Perhaps the most frustrating thing is that we had to wait 4 years for this, since their mediocre Q2K release in '99. I can understand getting mello with age, but save it for your solo projects. It's hard to imagine how much worse this CD would be if they didn't have DeGarmo helping out.

It has some good riffs and tunes, but where are the solos? Where are the guitar melodies? Where are Geoff's high vocals?

The contrast between the description of beauty and horror give the book much of its power. Much of the beauty is in the glimpses of the agrarian and community life, in the love of family, and some of it is in simple, stunning imagery.

Anyway, from the bottle it smells sweet and floral with maybe a little vanilla so it has a warm element to it.When I wear it though, the soft floral and vanilla kind of just merge together into a bland powder smell. Kind of a waste and is usually a sign that the perfume doesn't mesh with your natural oils.

298027," ANOTHER RIP-OFF: Early in 2005, there were a few Stones releases on the schedule that never saw the light of day. Stones freaks like myself salivated over the prospect of hearing these multi-disc collections, which promised outtakes and unreleased recordings and live songs from the late 1960s, and early 1970s. Instead we got this knock-off Christmas release that amounted to nothing more than theft. I bought 'Rarities' as soon as it came out (for full price). I had already bought 'Sucking In The Seventies'. Given the crossover of tracks, I soon felt like a TOTAL sucker. As for airbrushing out Bill Wyman-- this reminds me of the recent double-disc compilation which featured a thick booklet but no space for Mick Taylor. I love the Stones but I hate how they rip off their fans. And what's with the Stalin-like rewriting of history?",__label__1 
298028," Review for 12"" dance single collectors: So few Stones 12"" versions on CD...still!: There were only a handful of Rolling Stones songs that managed to make their way into the 12"" era of the late 70s and 80s, and while they are basically all on this mish-mosh of rareties, there's only ONE full length 12"". ""Mixed Emotions"" is it's full 6:10 12"" version. As other reviewers have stated, ""Miss You"" loses a minute. But also, The NY mix of ""Harlem Shuffle"" has been edited down by about 40 seconds! Not to mention, the original vinyl 12"" version of the song had two different mixes, the flip side being a UK 12"" mix. It would have been like striking gold to find that on here, too instead of all these live tracks (who cares?), as well as the FULL LENGTH 12"" versions of the other tracks.

I just don't agree with his explanations and solutions. The chapters are a jumble of ideas and hard to follow. You ask yourself, at the end of a chapter, ""What was the point?""It could be a good book, if it was re-written with a logical presentation of ideas, and more accurate science including some of the discoveries on hormones and brain development.

For Born Again Christians who are either in denial or who have an unwillingness to face the New Testament problems that Cayce presents, this book may be upsetting. His logic is often hard to argue with. Cayce simply does a good job of looking at Jesus without all the fluff that Christianity has bestowed on him. Cayce's points are reasonable and his conclusions seem well-thought out. Definitely worth reading.",__label__2

298074," Hunt wasn't given a chance to thrive in this one: I don't know about this one. Fairly good story, but thin in many areas. The main character is Wyatt Hunt a former military inspector and former child protective services field agent turned PI. Definitely not of the traditional gumshoe mold -- he's a bit too self aware with some scars from the past left by growing up in the foster care system and later losing his fiance. I really wanted to like this guy, but I don't think Lescroart developed his character well enough or allowed for a rich enough story line for him to grow on me. He did a far better job with the other characters in the book like Hunt's friends Amy Wu and Devin Juhle. But maybe Hunt grew on my just enough, because I do think that I'd give a ""Hunt"" novel another chance. Just to see where Lescroart can redeem him.",__label__1 
298075," First time for this author: A friend recommended John Lescroart's books. Did I make a poor choice? It seems I did. The Hunt Club seems to meander aimlessly. I'm now on page 286 and wondering if I should bother continuing. Even the promise that it will get better isn't motivating me. As an avid reader, I'm disappointed that I couldn't add Lescroart to my list of favorite authors. May it suffice to say that, in my opinion, ""The Hunt Club"" is no page-turner.",__label__1 
298076," I like Lescroart, but this is far from his best work.: The writing is not good. The plot lurches around down every possible dead end, including a long detailed search into the California correctional officers union. This provides Lescroart a platform for scathing critique of the guards and officers and the prison system, but turns out to have nothing to do with anything. The book has only the most implausible characters doing implausible and boring things like endlessly discussing, discussing, discussing who might be the bad guys, and where to go from here. The new investigator, Hunt is so cool as to be repugnant. Glitzky and Dismas were attractive, intelligent, funny characters. Hunt is flat and shallow, and he just doesn't ring true.",__label__1

While the author has a good grasp on the 'increasingly Unfree World' his solution is to continue to do nothing so no one will notice that you're doing something. The book offers few positive active suggestions for dealing with the cultural problem that he so clearly identifies. The book needs more develpment.

I got another air filter machine, (True Allergen Remover: HEPA type?) and that seems to help maybe as good as this machine, but as the bulb to this unit burnt out in just over two months of use, I'll be sticking with my other machine.

The problem however, is that this does not cover the entire room even on its ""high"" setting. Over the course of an hour, I would say this thing covers only a sixth of the air in our room (12 x 12). I put my hand in front of the sanitizer and could barely feel any airflow and this was on the high setting. I've only had this product for a month so I will have to follow-up on durability.First month impression is this thing is too weak to adequately sanitize an entire room. If it were a bit stronger, would give a better rating. I feel like I will return this item and get a stronger air cleaner, or buy 3 of these (not practical).",__label__1

I chose it over the other main brandTraditional Medicinals Organic Smooth Move Herbal Stimulant Laxative Tea, 16-Count Wrapped Tea Bags (Pack of 6)because, though the ingredients are mainly the same, the other tea contained fennel which I can't stand. This tea tastes fine. I don't like mint flavoring, and you can taste the mint, but it is subdued. I even drank this tea for pleasure once on a cold day when I had nothing else warm and calorie-free in the house.This tea definitely performs the stated purpose. It does get things moving. The active herb is senna, which contracts your digestive muscles to get things out. I find it causes me to cramp just a little too much, however I'll happily take a natural remedy to constipation that makes me cramp if it means I don't have to put the totally bizarre ingredients in over-the-counter laxatives in my body.

Anyone who doubts his scientific soundness should check out his massive ""Electrons & Phonons.""The main advantage of this book is that it emphasizes conceptual understanding over mathematical manipulation. That's also its weakness: Ziman often glosses over or just sketches what in other texts would be occasions for massive algebra. Perhaps if you are a true theorist type, you can fill in the blanks on your own.

He shows how Hitler used various esoteric techniques to create a magnetic personality and influence the mind of the mob.

I hadn't read this author before but she was reccommended to me by a few friends of mine. I'm not a big romance reader, read mostly sf/fantasy. This is a smart book. Loads of clever, underlying sugestions. The story was crisp enough to keep me turning pages long after I should have been asleep. The characters/role reversal grabbed me and kept me throughout. The sex scenes were no chopped liver either. The best thing about this novel, for me, were the satirical elements. Ms. Joy invites us to smile along with her as she takes a jab at Regency romance. I'd compare her most favourably with my favorite fantasy writers, Anne McCaffrey and Stephen R. Donaldson. She's a very good writer. Anyone who can come up with a popular dish called ""tasteslikerooster"" (in a female dominated society!) certainly gets my buck! Great sense of humor.

But I found all the new vocabulary rather tedious. At least for me, the story and characters did not measure up to previous novels. I was disappointed in that.

I personally could never live in a world like this, so I had trouble enjoying the story.The men in this book are treated pretty much the way many women are treated in Regency Romances (which I don't care for either.)

Not a bad idea, however with all the ""words"" she made up, that you are constantly referring the the dictionary in the back of the book to make sense of certain phrases, enough already. It has shades of Knight of a Trillion Stars in it. I could not wait for this book, but after reading it I could have waited forever and not missed much. I have learned some creative new ""swear"" words that nobody will be aware that I'm cussing them out. That is why I gave this book a 2 star rating instead of a 1 star rating. P.S.

It is extremely unreliable when it comes to networking (either PC or Mac). It took a week of constant chatter on the Tivo Forum to finally get it to work semi-reliably. I was willing to go with that, but the Time Warner came by to install the cards. Actually the installation went fine, however after we powered up the TivO we discovered that 95% of my HD channels could not be received. A call to Time Warner confirmed that their Cable Cards will not work with the Tivo and will only receive about 5% of the HD channels. So what good does it do to have a sophisticated device that won't work with the service I pay for.

If you want to cook some hamburgers and hot dogs it would probably work. But the other bad thing is that it's very low to the ground. Even on the highest setting it's not very convenient.

He also doesn't mention that Bush sent millions in tax-payer dollars to bin Laden only months prior to the attacks and that he did nothing more than Clinton did - even made the FBI back off further. What little mention he makes of Bush is in a partisan, favorable fashion. Such bios is already plentiful enough in media today.

The staging is very static, most people just stand there, although Joan's father is vigorous, and they did hire a choreographer apparently for a minute or two of a battle scene. The chorus looks like a church choir in red robes singing from their score books, on stage, right next to the main actors, incongruous and intrusive. Why didn't they dress them up as peasants?

The XML grammar itself was presented in difficult-to-read snippets of BNF notation, which is an incredibly irritating way to try to learn new concepts.

She's as eager as the ""ecoterrorists"" to pull up the drawbridge and let no one else settle in Sanpere, yet doesn't recognize her own hypocrisy. Her view of life was summed up, for me, in her belief that her family was entitled to first refusal on a plot of land owned by someone else, destined to be sold to someone else, simply because her family enjoyed looking at it.

298521," Broke in all of about 20 minutes.: I didn't buy this from Amazon, but from a local pet store. This ""Elite Radiant"" fish tank heater scared the crap out of me. I've had heaters before, so I know how to use them. I stuck it in my 10 gallon fish tank and turned it on. The indicator light came on and all was well. I went and watched TV on my bed and about 15 minutes later I noticed the light was flashing. I thought this was because it had reached the temperature, when in fact, it went from 68 degrees to 85 in a matter of 15 minutes. Then, I proceeded to notice that the heater must have had a crack in it because it was filling with water and the indicator light was flashing because it was shorting out. I pulled it out of the water, and stuck it in my bathroom until it cooled down. I'm glad my fish weren't fried. Don't buy this... I unfortunately wasted 8 dollars on it. If you value your fish you'll get something better.",__label__1 
298522, Can be deadly: After having used this heater for over 6months now I think I can safely conclude that it's very badly designed and can be deadly. In my case I constantly struggled with trying to keep the temperature of the water at the right levels by having to adjust the knob and then go back into monitoring my thermometer. One day while I was cleaning my aquarium apparently the knob turned a little over the normal without having a stop it fried all my fish. Now I know this was accidental but the system should have a safety shut off temperature in their internal sensor goes over 85F. No tropical fish and very few sea water fish can survive that temperature. In my case I woke up with an aquarium full of dead fishes. Use my review as caution unless you want to constantly monitor manually the temperature and some day may wake up with DEAD fishes.,__label__1

But this review is intended for those who might not be familiar with the history of California, or may have read only the novels, journalism, or light non-fiction treatments. Don't be put off by the publication date or the book's level of detail--it is a very enjoyable read! The authors were not scholars or historians, but rather a doctor, a lawyer, and a journalist.

This is Sebastian's most fully realized album, not a bum track on the whole album and I'm a little mystified at some of the lukewarm revues. Maybe the album is a little TOO eclectic.

Don't put this shampoo on any spots that may have open skin. I did and my dog almost chewed his tail off.The results from the bath left my dogs skin very clean and within the hour all his hot spots were nearly gone. His hair was the best it has ever been.

298649," Synopsis: Narrated by Robert Urich.Approx. 60 minutes.From the back:The canyons of Southern Utah and the Four Corners region echo with history. Actor Robert Urich narrates on the area's most compelling stories - that of its ancient Anasazi Civilization which inhabited the Four Corner Region nearly 2000 years ago. To walk through the scattered Anasazi ruins of national monuments and parks like Hovenweep, Mesa Verde and Chaco Canyon is to feel ""The Winds of Time.""This documentary takes an in depth look at an early civilization we can undoubtedly learn form today, highlighting the Anasazi's culture, the means by which they lived in harmony with the environment, and their sophisticated archaeological dwellings.",__label__2 
298650," Not like the soundtracks: The songs on this CD are nothing like the Matrix soundtracks. Their relatively slow beats and word-heavy songs make them more like listening to someone read poetry to the beat of a bongo than the fast-paced music from the movie. If you liked the movie soundtracks because of their fast-paced techno themes and (sometimes) operatic choruses, don't buy this CD.",__label__1 
298651," great, not greatest: Another impeccably crafted set by Mr. Blegvad. Not as remarkable as ""King Strut"" or ""Naked Shakespeare"", but close. More fun than his last pop album (with the eye cover). Peter can be incredibly witty, poetic, and poignant, and his latest does not disappoint. Musically, the title song reminds me of ""Chuck E.'s In Love"", but still unique. The two songs from Slapp Happy's ""Cava"" that show up here in quieter, more reflective versions, are simply brilliant.",__label__2

As an attorney, I am used to working with that kind of logic. Give me a conclusion or an idea and then explain how you arrived at it. It's the knowing of how one has arrived at the idea that allows others to learn from it.

No voltage drop, with room to spare for the next heavy bass note. Comes with a big LED display. Again, this thing is HUGE. Make sure you have a lot of room for it.

A few other reasons are that instead of saying on the card MRD or LOB or whatever or it says SDJ.

When I got to the part where she said that describing the Bogomil philosophy was critical to understanding the mass rapes in 1992 and 1993, I nearly tossed the book in the trash. The Bogomils were a medieval religious sect that died out in the 1500s. Recent scholarship has questioned not only their influence, but also whether the Bosnian nobles were even Bogomils in the first place. The writer relies on a single interview with a seemingly distraught woman, she quotes extensively from the interview and decides that understanding this obscure theology is a useful tool for her readers. Maybe if she'd done the research instead of quoting someone she felt sorry for, the book would be better.",__label__1

I fall on the high side, I suppose. I enjoyed the large number of photos and ideas for landscaping small areas - spots even - in the yard around a smaller home.One, rather unreal aspect was that, most of the homes pictured are modern homes with interesting custom architecture. Some of us live in simple ranch-styles (boxes).Julie's training and interest in architecture does come through, but I did not find it distracting. In fact, I found the emphasis on the relationship between the interior design of the home and landscape as seen from inside very useful.

While Hope wasn't his constant comical self, his interplay with his children, who had some of the better lines to Hope's straight man part, both on and off stage, were great fun. The other high point of the film was James Cagney's role as George M. Cohan, one he made famous earlier in Yankee Doodle Dandy. The constant one upmanship between the two and their table top dance routine were the high point of the film. If you like Bob Hope, you'll enjoy this movie.",__label__2

Loved the nine pairs of woodcuts, each with one tiny, crucial difference; loved the history of book-bindings and -burnings. Loved the meditations on the greatness of Dumas and other swashbuckling trash; loved the allusions to Sherlock Holmes. I was hooked, for a while, on the occult events, baroque settings, and twisty plot. But the ending was the lamest ""faux-po-mo"" cop-out imaginable. Bah humbug!

All this is set within the elite class of a Spanish culture -- refined and erudite, with a tinge of Bohemia. It is noir of a distinctly different flavor and appealing on that basis alone. But the author also blends in facinating tidbits about the world of the written word, both physical and meta-physical. All this combines to successfully generate a strong sense of place and mood -- the signs of a fine story in the Chandler tradition. Sadly, the Club Dumas also suffers from the standard Chandler downfall -- the fizzling plot resolution. And, in fact, the ending of the book comes as an anti-climax. But go back and read the passages about bookbinding and Alexander Dumas and the cafes. These are the true pleasures of this book.",__label__2

Minute details about book collecting overwhelmed me with tears of boredom. There's the stereotypical fetching young woman who all we know about is that she uses a name from a Sherlock Holmes story and is a kick boxer of some talent because she can beat up an actor? Meanwhile, the evil ""pay no attention to the man behind the curtains"" guy surfaces only briefly at beginning an end. And if I read the word ""apocryphal"" one more time I would have puked.

No way to return it.

Thank goodness I listened to it first! I usually end up liking some of the songs on my daughter's CDs because I end up listening to them all the time, but this CD is totally WORTHLESS. Even if you remove the profanity - which is totally pointless to begin with because it adds nothing to the music - the only thing left is a bunch of cheerleader music....and that's not what people have come to expect from Avril Lavigne.

298798," Being Fair....I am a fan of hers: and I really enjoyed her previous works, more than I could have ever imagined, but this record is horrible. The songs are trite, the lyrics are incredibly boring, indulgent and immature. The music is pop staple, with forgetable melodies and repetative chorus lines, I feel as if the studio wrote the entire album for her while she was sleeping, this just doesn't speak to any of her previous works at all. This album fits on the same shelf with a Nickelodeon-themed CD. Instead of heading in the direction of an artist like Alanis Morrisette, she is going backward and joining the ranks of Hannah Montana and the Naked Brothers Band. She is a great artist and her first two records are amazing. She is better than this CD and I am looking forward to her next effort.",__label__1

Please do not support garbage like this, buy real music, go search for indepedent rock bands, anything, please there is so much good real music out there, the fact that people waste their money buying trash like this makes me so sad.

The player does not offer any display for what chapter you are on and in more DVD plays than not, the movies begin skipping around an hour and a half in. I have also experienced ""freezes"" if a movie has been paused for more than about an hour.

In the delicious discomfort of feeling scared and enchanted, made life a little more understandable as well as providing that ""suspension of disbelief"" that served to teach us the world is a far more enchanted place than authority figures and institutions would have us believe. And I do not think I'm alone in this perception, or fantasy and science fiction would not be as popular among adults as they are now.

She is a musical force of nature on her other two albums, listening to which, I became a fan. I jumped on this album when it appeared, and desperately tried to like it.I'm not a fan of Christian pop. Not because of the message, but because the presentation of it is usually so dull and formulaic, and the music is usually poor. Unfortunately, all of this applies to this album. I think Lisa wrote, and may have produced this album. I love her talent too much to conjecture on the motivation as to why this album was produced.I found the music, Lisa's performance, the production and recording, and the instrumental accompaniment all poor. I don't question her faith, but the great gifts she was given deserve to be presented in their fullest. Lisa Haley is just much better Saturday evening than Sunday morning.",__label__1

Between Keiji Haino, Merzbow, Muddy World, Ruins, Otomo Yoshihide, Acid Mothers Temple and the Boredoms, you'd think the place would be bled dry of anything new to offer up. Alas, such is not the case as Koenjihyakkei prove, who manage to add their name to the list of great avant/prog artists like those above. I honestly hear something new every time I throw this one in the changer. The shifting dynamics, tight compositions and excellent playing ability of all involved makes this one of the best whim purchases for me thus far.

Check out Sony's ATRAC system before you buy this, it is a nightmare transferring content to the MD. The sound however is really good, Sony knows how to split the stereo up to very good effect, but overall I sold this because I couldn't listen to what I wanted to. Check out eBay too, they're going for $50! That tells you something right there when you pay $100 and sell it the next day for $50 on eBay!",__label__1

You can fit more music on cheap MD's, and have multiple MD's for the moods you are in.As for the software, Sony finally got wise and formed an agreement with realOne player to use it to download music to the player. Once you've loaded the netMD drivers, download the realOne player, and the plug in for Sony devices. You will be much happier in the long run.",__label__2

298859," Lasted A Week: I bought this everlast swivel a week ago along with an everlast 4210 speedbag from acadamy. I am not a boxer, and do not plan to be one. I only bought the speedbag and swivel to do something physically active that isn't as boring as running. The swivel only lasted a week till the first link (the eyelet) completely detached from the ball socket. There is a small screw inside the socket's ball which attaches the first link. After using an allen wrench to put it back together. Again, after 20 minutes of practice on the speed bag, the swivel broke again. Judging by the construction of other speed bag swivels, this is the only swivel where this problem arises, and is likely to occur often. I would recomend this swivel only if you are getting a speed bag for a youngster (under 14), or just need one for display. If you plan on spending more than a couple hours a week messing around on a speed bag, go with the Everlast Top Professional Chain Link Swivel (Model # 4444).",__label__1

Uh, no, it's because it is not a very good or accurate book, yet the author goes on and on about how everyone else is wrong and they don't have anything to back up their ideas. It would be very interesting to understand what is driving this author.

The book is a bait-and-switch, because the concept of ""spares"" (using body parts of a clone to replace those in the original person when needed) which is very interesting, is not a central part of the story.

It glosses over many of the events, and if you have the background that's O.K. because you KNOW the necessary details. But, if you are mostly clueless about the times the necessary background to understand why events are occurring is arguably sparse.I also find the use of current era talking heads from 1990s to explain what is happening is a bit distracting. We had fine news coverage in the 1960s. Why not use that footage to explain the times and supplement it with comments from current social commentators, rather than do it in the reverse as this production does.For those who want to relieve the days, it's an O.K. piece, though a bit shallow.

""Feud for Sale"" is by far the best, even though Ren and Stimpy aren't even in it. Instead there's that crooked salesman guy who's always so darn hilarious. ""Superstitious Stimpy"" and ""I Was a Teenage Stimpy"" are the other must-have episodes in this set, and I'm rather fond Ren and Stimpy's observance of Acromeglian customs in ""Travelogue"" myself.But my favorite episode out of them all is probably ""Reverend Jack Cheese.""

If you have rosacea that is anything past looking like a mild sunburn, this product will only make it worse. I think a lot of us would do just about anything to have their rosacea be simply a flushed face, as most of us have to deal with things that are devastating to our self esteems, and at the least uncomfortable and painful.

Through a series of publically unimportant, though personally tragic human losses, two people meet who seem to have nothing in common except the most basic need of a mate. What they actually have in common, however, is their method of ""navigating"" life: their vision fixes on one goal, as ancient mariners fixed a telescopic gaze on a star, or the horizon, to guide them across the trackless oceans. The protagonists' desire to reach their goals in a world they do not understand determines every decision each one makes, even if it is wrong, will lead to disaster, or will ultimately break their hearts.

The narrator is a sophisticated elitist, the editor of travel books that pour scorn on package tourists and unadventurous stay-at-homes. She is clever and sarcastic. In the end there is a suggestion that there is a link between her elitism and a Nietzschean (did I spell that right) contempt for the common herd that drives her son to exult in cruelty.Can fiction explain things about human motivation that straight biography cannot? What went on in the minds of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold? What must it have been like to the parent of one of them.

This book offers the answer in characters that are so dark, it's unbelieveable. I'm sorry I bought it - as the mother of a 3 and 5 year old, my times to read are precious, fleeting and usually at the cost of sleep. This was a terrible waste of that time.

She's a tiny 4 yr old, so maybe they'd fit an average kid better, but they slid right off of her. The mask is hard plastic and a bit uncomfortable, so she wore it for pictures and took it off the rest of the time.She loved her costume though, and it looked really cute. Everything else was fine.

It talks briefly about what these churches believe about the Body and Blood of Jesus in the Eucharist and then gives several examples of miracles that have happened regarding this phenomenon. Also, it talks about many saints, their devotion to the Eucharist, and miracles that have been attributed to them related to the Eucharist.If you have a scientific mind that causes you to doubt religion or the existence of God in general, this book would be great to read because in many of the examples, the author details how the miracle was studied and tested by doctors and scientists to varify if there was any other possible explanation for what happened.

Let me say, this is my favorite album ever. Moon and antartica is better than pink floyd, radiohead, anything else. it was a masterpiece. I heard theyd had a new album coming out, so i looed into it. I was taken aback when hearing them on the radio. Not too much later, i was soon feeling weary.

Hearing their songs repeated endlessly on the radio stirred up as much confusion as I felt back when ""Hit Me Baby One More Time"" flooded the radio. I don't think this band has a great deal of vocal talent, and the melodies they employ only emphasize this. The worst instance of this has to be on ""Ocean Breathes Salty"" when the band sings a capella and instead of being a fun break (like I'm assuming it was intended to be), the vocals sound more off-key than fun. The lyrics are, in general, lacking in creativity. They DO try to be creative, but it usually fails.

I've heard better speakers that cost half as much. Do not buy Bose Companion 2 Series 2 speakers unless they are selling for $40.

It is obvious the franchising industry is extremely one sided. A lot needs to be done to make laws that are equitable and fair. It is amazing that even in a country like the USA a huge number of franchisors are able to get away with exploitation of investors. Lawmakers need to wake up to this and do what they have been elected for. I read some other books on franchising before I read this one. They do not even come close to offering the advice offered in this book even though they had very good reviews on Amazon.com.

299123," Average pulp fiction.: Mildly entertaining - worth the sale price for the novelty of Hugh Laurie's first published novel. Perhaps my expectations of Laurie were too high. The plot was unbelievable and the characters were stereotypical caricatures. The ""cleverisms"" I was looking forward to were present in spades, but delivered so unnaturally in the narrative that they jarred me out of the story line; it felt like the main character was delivering snarky asides to the reader, sometimes at the expense of the other characters. ""Wink, wink, I'm not taking this life-threatening situation any more seriously than an episode of Fry & Laurie. Snicker.""That said, The Gun Seller *was* entertaining, if too fluffy for my tastes.

299124," Another reason to love Hugh Laurie: If you thought Hugh Laurie was just an amazing actor, then you need to read his wonderful first (and hopefully not last) book.

I'd love to see a dramatization, but the second half of the book wouldn't go down well with the average viewer. There is a definite change of pace, strangely enough without losing a sense of humor, throughout the tale. The tone becomes so odd that I have to give it four stars. Regardless, the story is addictive and extremely well written. This is a definite must for Stephen Fry fans, whose influence is quite obvious throughout(and whose praise adorns the jacket). There is also -at least at the beginning- a sense of the P.G. Wodehouse perspective. I've not read a better spy novel, and I've read a lot worse. If Mr. Laurie continues to write, I'm sure he will become not just a comic genius, but a great novelist as well. All in all, a strange novel by an incredibly talented man. I'm sure that the best is to come...........",__label__2

The story is intriguing, especially if you enjoy noir and PI stories, and Laurie's writing style is very quick and humorous, with many cultural references. The main character is more intricate than he at first seems, and like all good characters, I can identify with him. Some people have compared his writing to Wodehouse. I'm not sure why, I suppose because he once played a Wodehouse character. To me, his writing style is like Laurie, and that's a compliment.",__label__2

299137," Excellent, excellent and excellent!: Several months ago I saw the movie ""Gettysburg"" based on Michael Saara's novel- The Killer Angels. Since I was deeply moved by the film I decided to buy the book. I couldn't put it down- it was even stronger that the film. M Saara didn't try to stick to one side of the story: he wrote it from the point of view of those who took part in the Civil War with no regard to the colour of their uniform. He portrays us the battles and the feelings of the soldiers from both camps in an intelligent and beautiful way and style. After his father's death, Jeff Saara decided to continue his work by writing two other books which all together make a wonderful and touching trilogy. The two novels written by Jeff are as good as 'The Killer Angels' and I would like to shake his hand and tell him how breathtaking and deeply human this trilogy is. Good work!

299139," More Hype less Substance: The women's movement brought us a lot of well constructed books that considered the problem of gender relations in a serious light. The men's movement has done the same. Both movements spawned a number of books and ""experts"" that were, essentially, poor and opportunistic works. The Men's Room is one of these opportunistic pop-psychology books. There is little substance to this work other than the usual trite admonishments that men need to get in touch with their feelings and need to relate to women in a way that women want. Nothing is said of the needs of men or of a gender role sharing of committment and intimacy within a relationship either between men and women or between men and men in the wider community. This genre of writing does nothing to enhance understanding of the masculine identity. There are many other good books that do.....read them instead.",__label__1

Then I discovered Z Lensman, read it, enjoyed it, then came back and read Dragon.I do suggest, however, that you read Dragon first, then Z second, as Z builds on some of the events of Dragon, then, of course, read the Rigellian version.If you love E.E.Smith's books, as I do, then definitely read David Kyle's three Lensman books, written from the points of view of the other three Second Stage Lensmen.John (www.MAZES.com) Knoderer",__label__2

I made the mistake of not reading reviews before I purchased the book. Bad call! I have read a lot of books on the Civil War in general and US Grant in particular. To my mind, for anyone interested in Grant here's what you should read: Grant's own Personal Memoirs, Bruce Catton's works (Grant Moves South; Grant Takes Command and US Grant and the American Military Tradition) and JFC Fuller's masterful Grant & Lee: A Study in Generalship.

But this so called tribute album absolutely sucks! The woman who is trying to sing Mariah's great songs is messing them up. Her voice can't even be compared to Mariah's.

SOMEBODY GIVE ME A KNIFE!: I don't know what this girl was thinking when she decided to botch up Mariah Carey's high notes, but somebody needs to put her out of her misery.MAYBE if an ensemble of well-known singers attempted a tribute to Mariah, it would pass (e.g., ""Divas 2000: Tribute to Diana Ross,"" with Mariah Carey, Donna Summer, & Faith Hill). But this circus of unknowns? What the hell were the executives thinking when they released this into the public eye? That people would get excited and demand an album from the ""tribute"" singer?Sorry, don't think so. Obviously, somebody at Big Eye Records decided to mock Mariah Carey and released this album as a joke. This CD belongs in the comedy section of your favorite music store.",__label__1

He teaches finances at his local church. That's not an expert. This is truly one of the worst books I've ever read. It appears to be self published. The desktop publishing looks like a ransome note and gives me a headache. The author is poverty stricken in relationship to literature. He's not intelligent but he is judgemental.

There are 2 stories within one story and they don't mix well. The characters could have been developed a bit more. Actually there was so many characters that I wanted to learn more about but she didn't give enough of a description. Lots of fluffy words --- she definately gets an A+ for her use of adjectives.

299223," Affordable but...: Commendably, Mr. Brooksher has added another volume to the limited literature devoted to the American Civil War in the West. The author concentrates the majority of the text to setting the stage, discussing events leading up to and following the outbreak of the war; but then does a credible job narrating the battle itself. His prose does tend to be a little ""purple,"" from time to time (""angel of death,"" ""happy camper,"" and ""spit-warm ditch water"") but it is a fascinating tale, replete with colorful characters. Decent maps and well done orders of battle compliment the text. His bibliography seems a bit padded to me with Ken Burns and American Heritage thrown in with the more often seen ""Jennison's Jayhawkers,"" Castel's ""Sterling Price,"" and Tunnard's ""3d Louisiana."" A few too many secondary sources to suit me, personally. Nonetheless, good intro volume before purchasing Piston's or Bearss' volumes.

WEAK!4.Sure pump it up was [great]! , but one song aint gonna make you the best, plus it was made by Just Blaze5.Busta,Kelly, 112, Lil Mo's ft.'s are great - if you block out JoeJoe was OK underground but just doesn't have what it takes to have his own album",__label__1

I figured I would buy the album because I figured that the other songs on the album would be just as good. Don't get me wrong a couple of songs are good including ""Pump It Up"" and ""Porno Star"" but other than those two and one or two more are pretty good. Other than that the album [is bad]. It is a vastly overrated album sung by an overrated rapper. To me Joe Budden can be categorized as a one hit wonder....",__label__1

I didnt like the intro but when #1 came on I thought that was a hot track. After that Pump it Up came on and after hearing it so much its still on fire. I had to skip Pusha Man but I came back to it later. You Ain't Gotta Go Home was catchy and infectious as ever and Walk With Me was...nah I wasn't feeling it. She Wanna Know and Survivor were okay but Fire with Busta on it... that was a hot track! Ma Ma Ma was a song that either you like or you dont and I did'nt like it. The album started getting better with Calm Down. Because after that we got blessed with Focus which is the best track on the album and Give Me Reason which is a pretty good track. Stand Up Nucca, 10 Mins,and Real Life In Rap were all hot tracks but why did Porno Star have to be on here?Anyway, there are a handful of great songs on here but the cons outweigh the pros and you end up having a below average album.",__label__1

""The Green Mile"" takes you into the horrors of one of the most controversial places in society, death row. The narrator is the head guard of the row, and the stories that Stephen King tells through him are nothing short of amazing.

299286," Unhygienic lid design!!: I loved this cup when I first purchased it. I'd scoured the internet and stores for a no-spill thermal cup, and thought I'd finally found the perfect one. However, after a few months of use, I noticed I could hear liquid trapped in the lid. If I shook the lid violently, I could get out some drops of the trapped liquid, but never all of it. I also noticed that the the lid would smell awful at the end of a day's use and really demanded washing immediately after use (which in my mind, defeats the purpose of the ""travel"" mug).Eventually I had to throw away the lid as the thought of the trapped old coffee/dishwashing liquid/bacteria buildup seepage was not only disgusting, but potentially harmful...My only regret is that I hastily threw away the lid in disgust and didn't mail it back to OXO as proof that a redesign is in order!!",__label__1

299288," Great Mug, But It Can't Be Cleaned!: The idea for this mug is good, but like so many others have said it just can't be cleaned. It keeps beverages hot, the seal works great and is convenient, and the mug looks great. But the fatal flaw is that the top can't be cleaned.I purchased this mug thinking that all of the people saying the mug couldn't be cleaned were just doing it wrong, but that's just not the case. It is practically impossible to clean the top of this mug well. I cleaned with boiling water and soap for a good 10 minutes and I could still smell coffee odors coming from the inside of the top. Those odors would later impart flavor into the drinks I was consuming from the mug; so I just ended up not using the mug anymore.If OXO could design a mug where the inside of the top could be cleaned this product would be a definite 5 stars.Maybe a separate threaded cap on the bottom of the top to expose the inner area?",__label__1

I boiled some hot water and then poured into the mug,screwed the lid back on, and let it sit for about five mins. Then I poured it out and poured some hot water back into it. I then let that sit for about twenty mins....about the amount of time I would need before I would be able to drink hot coffee.....it was still just as hot. I also turned it upside down and it didn't leak out. It also has an easy clean lid. You can screw the inside of the lid off to clean it and hand wash only. I'll see how it works tomorrow. I used the mug for the first time today. My coffee stayed hot for two hours. I drank it when I got to work and I spent about an hour drinking it. It was still just as hot as when I started. Number one tip to keeping it hot.....pour boiling hot water into it. See above for details.",__label__2

299292," Lasted 6 months: I've had this mug for 6 months. I got it for a long bus commute to work in DC. First, you cannot take the top apart to clean it. After about 3 months, the rubber gaskets started falling out (I have only hand-washed this mug). Annoying, but I could tuck them back in; however, eventually, it became a routine.Around the 6 month mark, the button on the top started sticking in, so it wouldn't close without working at it, trying to get my fingernail under it to pull it out, and eventually stopped closing at all. I would have to take the top off, and push the plunger back up into it to get it to close.Tonight after soaking the top in vinegar overnight, I took all the gaskets out and held it up to the light so I could see how dirty it was inside. Crud and gunk (looked like barnacles, no kidding) was all up inside of the top. Ugh.. Yeah.. so here I am.. looking for another mug. Don't buy this thing.

299294," Works well, doesn't leak, but lid is designed poorly.: I agree with others about the leak-proof and keep-warm features of the mug, but the lid is not designed well, as far as cleaning goes. I have noticed that my lid smells absolutely disgusting, after using it maybe about 15 times. I get the feeling that there is no way to completely clean the lid, since there are areas inside of it that you can not get to with a sponge. And yes, I try to clean it very well every time I use it, and have not washed it in the dishwasher. Yesterday I tried soaking it completely submerged for a few hours, and that seemed to help a little bit. I think though, that if the smell continues, I will take my chances and put it through the dishwasher, just to try to sanitize it.

299295," Spill Proof Yes, Sanitary..um No.: After using this cup 3 times, it wasn't usable any more which was very disappointing as it worked great up to that point. What went wrong was, this cup didn't always get rinsed with in minutes after being used (it would sometimes sit for a few hours, who has time or a place to hand wash a cup while on the go which is what this cup is for?). And coffee/cream and what not would get trapped up in the mechanism that helped keep the leak proof lid, leak proof.We tried the dishwasher, soaking in hot water and soap and even bleach and the ROTTEN MILK smell that got stuck up in there never came out until it was slightly masked by the bleach. Obviously whatever is in that cup that makes it spill proof makes it impossible for a real deep clean. I had to toss it out.It was really great for a spill proof mug, but not very sanitary if you ask me.",__label__1

As a group they shift in a more adult contemporary direction, than idiosyncratic singer/songwriter and that kind of fits. The music is still compelling and entertaining I'm just not sure that this is the exact type of music they should be making. It just doesn't sound completely natural, but it's still good.

This makes it take on a rather flat and overpowering floral note, without any of the more interesting characteristics of violet (real violet flavouring always had a spicy undertone that reminded me of celery seed.)Additionally, the artificial colouring gives it a bitter note on the back of the tongue.

This is clearly shown on the book cover and also the dvd cover ie we can read about it on-line.As consumers we have become used to having the most impressive stuff on the dvd, and the book as a back-up. In this case, it works the other way round. One could describe the material as being in the ""Beginner to Intermediate"" range and the cover could have made this clearer.However Mr Soph covers details that even some advanced players/teachers are not always aware of, so it's worth checking out regardless of level.The DVD is really like a follow up lesson to make sure you approach the book correctly.

Like all spring-loaded retractable cables you shouldn't really pull hard and fast on it or it will tangle on the reel and then you're out of luck. But given proper care, the retractor mechanism works well.My only two complaints: First, the cable isn't well shielded and is therefore prone to picking up outside interference. If you plan on using this cable in an electronically noisy area then you may find some background humming going on. And second, the retractor mechanism feels kind of cheap. Not ""fall apart in your hands"" cheap but more like ""I wish they would have made this out of sturdier plastic"" cheap. Still, of the retractable cables I've seen, this is one of the sturdier ones.",__label__2 
299379," okay cable: This cable is okay. the cable itself is thin and I would think that it will kink or would be easily damaged. I bought it for only a short-term use, and it served it's purpose.

The sound with this cable was fine.",__label__1 
299380," Fantastic sound for the price, but ergonomics are lacking.: The iGrado headphones have got to be the best quality sound you can possibly get for the price. I've gone through and listened to most of my music library again just to see how differently they sound through my new headphones. They facilitate incredible clarity and depth I had only previously experienced through studio quality phones. I can turn them up very loud without hurting my ears and without completely blocking out the outside world (which is usually a good thing). The only complaint I have is the plastic its made out of is very stiff, and it squeezes my head a bit too much (As I have a pretty big head) and my ears get a little sore after a while.If you are looking for very high quality headphones for casual use on the cheap, there isn't a better deal out there. But wide-headed people beware! Your ears will begin to complain midway through your average album.",__label__2

After several work out sessions I can say they are quite comfortable and never feel like they are going to fall off while I'm running. The sound is as good as a more expensive pair of Shure in ears that I own. I think at this price point it would be hard to find a better sounding pair of headphones. The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is I would like to see a bit better cable on them. It seems a bit thin. But, at this price point I can't really complain. Oh, and my wife that didn't want me to spend this much money on a pair of headphones to work out in now wants a pair for herself :)",__label__2

299420," Great and Colorful!: This is a colorful rhyming book, from the birth of an egg, to a caterpillar, to butterfly. The book talks about the life cycle of butterflies. After the story there are several pages that share information about butterflies. At the end of the book there are pages about the different types of butterflies with pictures to identify them. Each of the butterflies also includes a picture of the caterpillar it was before it became a butterfly. There is a page of information about butterflies, labeling each part of the butterfly and information about butterflies. The last page of the book has information about flowers, with a picture to describe the flower.This would be a great book for first grade. The rhyming patterns make the book easy to follow. A teacher would be able to introduce butterflies and the different parts of them. As a class they could create a timeline of the butterflies, from the start as an egg.",__label__2 
299421," Surprisingly worth the money!: I bought these hoping they would be sturdier than the discount bookcases they were replacing. I couldn't be happier. The shelves are very sturdy and while they go together easily like cheap ones, they don't feel or look like cheap ones.Rather than just a load-bearing poster of paneling in the back, there is an actual back piece that goes from the floor to the fixed shelf. This adds sturdiness and helps prevent the loaded bookcase from falling over.I received them in better than expected condition, which was a bonus. The only possible negative is that the variable shelves aren't as wide front-to-back as the fixed shelf. So, if you're like me and have to have them all the same profile to the front, there's a space left in the back. However, the shelves themselves are quite deep, so this is a minor problem at the very most--that is, you're not going to drop books back there.",__label__2

299425," To Repeat Myself: I have already reviewed the Symphony No. 3 in this Bax symphonic cycle on Naxos, but after listening to it -- the whole run -- again, I thought I'd write very briefly about this installment to reaffirm my love of the entire set. At least one reviewer has doubts about the first movement in this recording conducted by David Lloyd-Jones, thinking it too aggressive. I don't know that I'd disagree with that judgement, but in the end it's a possible shortcoming that I'm willing to overlook. The entire performance of the symphony -- and the two accompanying tone poems -- is so lush and sensuous that those initial rumblings, perhaps a little excessive at times, are quickly forgotten. This entire run of Bax's symphonic output plus other orchestral works is truly magnificent, and combined with the Naxos price make the full set an obvious top choice. This is my second vote in favor of that notion.",__label__2

A lot of this consists of material drawn from his ""You Are Diseased"" record and other older stuff as well, so if you're already a fan, steer clear. Having his material prsented in an audiobook format (him in a studio reading into a microphone with no crowd interplay) just deadens much of the material and makes you overly conscious of how he does the magic. There are times when he reads off stuff that, when you hear it live, you think is aside material (the errant curse word, the witty follow-up). When presented here, this normally dicey flavor just comes off scripted and flat.Stick to his live records. This is just an attempt to stay in the mix because the book versions do so well (bearing in mind, the books basically codify his stage material beyond the excellent ""Brain Droppings"" tome).",__label__1

Second....Chapter 9 again, page 212, Bosnia and Herzegovina (better known as Bosnia only) was NOT part of Former Soviet Union (USSR). If you don't know the facts and don't care to present them accurately - do not write a book. Or, publish it and let everybody see how ignorant the whole project was.

I was excited about the simplicity of it all, even though it took a long time to make actual ""bread"".We love sourdough, real sourdough, ""Sanfrancisco style"" bread. This can hardly be called that. It was dense, hard and tasted like a dog biscuit. Yes, I have made dog biscuits too. Even my dog wouldn't eat it after sniffing it. My husband almost cut himself trying to cut into this dense loaf. Tasteless, unless you like eating plain wheat straw.As for the starter, it was amazing to watch this thing bubble up. Who knew? But I would recommend that you not smell it, unlike the author. It smells like baby vomit. It's not a good yeasty smell but an ugly sour smell.I have never given a bad review on Amazon, but this begged for it.

A serial killer is stalking southern california. The killer is captured. This is where most standard WW stories end. And this is where The Hyde Effect breaks from the pack. The killer confesses to being a werewolf. He is transported to a government research facility where his ""delusion"" can be studied by the top specialist of the day. But at moonfall, in front of dozens of witnesses...All Hell Breaks Loose. And with the facilities fail safes triggered, the building is sealed with hundreds of victims inside.

Old Magic was interesting enough so I decided to give it a go.The story itself is light on the witchcraft ways. It doesn't go in-depth to explain spells and what not so those who aren't into the whole scene won't be so freaked or confused. It's main purpose isn't to get people to accept witchcraft ways, but to allow people to see what could be out there. This is done in a way that people will desire.Not that gripping of a story but fun and a good read otherwise. The characters' thoughts get repetitive a few times but it can be easily overlooked.This definitely isn't a light read. The book is over 300 pages long. Quite a good story though. It mixes romance, witchcraft, medieval times, and the problems of today and that of the past.Totally freaky- in a good old magic sort of way.",__label__2

I then bought it because of the great reviews I read about the story, so I had very high expectations for the book.The story was not outstanding or different from other books I have read. It is also very evident that this is the author's first book.I think the reason why I didn't like this book was because the plot was so simple and everything just happened to fit. For example, Jarrod just so happens to be the seventh or whatever numbered child just when Kate asked. Also, Jarrod's character irked me to no end. He is such a dependent and passive character until the very end when he finally shows some courage. There were some parts in the book where I just wished Kate would leave Jarrod so that he'll finally believe after he keeps blowing things up.This book was very boring and not worth a read unless you have nothing better to do.",__label__1

I wish Harmon had written Barbershop 2, because it wasn't funny like the first one. I cried laughing during every conversation Eric LeBaron and the doctor had (minus the end).

So I overpaid for these by about double the price, given what I received.However, the batteries seem to have a decent amount of charge, at l;east compared to the one that was formerly in the device. (There was no expiration date on the package so I have no real idea how old these are or how long they will last, but for now it is so far so good.)I would not buy these again online given the number of similar reviews to this one - buy this type of battery locally in a drug store or other shop where you can see the expiration date BEFORE you buy.I am giving this 1 star for the deceptive marketing and overcharging for less than half of the 5-pack strip this was torn off of.",__label__1

His insatiable desire to learn everything about shooting is cheerfully expressed in his work. His book covers critical aspects of shooting that would help every experience level.

299567, Worth it just to see it: Without repeating what others have said about how good this is (and it is) the thought I have is to appreciate being able to see it at all. Given the production values (high) the cast (superb) the sound (excellent) - to be able to watch this piece in 16:9 on a large screen is an absolute delight. And what a performance- Le Riche in a tour de force of dancing and acting with other etoiles of the POB at their best. The only caveat is that some of the camerawork does not show crowd scenes to their best advantage being too low on the screen otherwise this fine production is highly recommended.,__label__2 
299568," A horrible choreography for a great classic: I am sad to recommend people to avoid this product. I say so because the choreography is absolutely wretched. The music is horrible, jagged and choppy, the choreography is horrible, as jagged and coarse. The POB is my favorite company and Nicholas Le Riche and Isabel are my favorites-The fault is not theirs. I have almost all of the POB stuff and I must rate this as the worst. Now as much as I am a fan of classical ballet, I do like modern ballet provided it sticks to norms of what good dance accompanied by good music should be. I would rate POB's Clavigo and Sylvia as vastly superior to this work. I tried to get into this several times but could only stomach it for 15m or so. I despair that given a plot and story as only a great Hugo could have created, and given that this is in POB's backyard and knowing their potential (La Bayadere, etc) and to have hacked the whole thing as they have done is unforgivable.",__label__1

299599, Adobe Elements 3.0: I was disappointed with Elements 3.0. I purchased it because I wanted to put more than 1 music selection with the slide shows that I made. It performed that function but the resolution of the slide shows suffered because of a 3rd party program that produced the slide shows on a VCD instead of a CD. My computer which is fairly new with Windows XP Home and a LCD monitor worked perfectly with Adobe Photoshop 2.0 and produced very sharp pictures. The new 3.0 does NOT work on my computer and will only work on a TV through a DVD player. The DVD player worked but the resolution of the pictures was very poor and could only show it on a TV.

PhotoShop Elements on the other hand is very complicated. What I could do with one or two clicks of the mouse, now takes four or five. The various tool buttons do not have 'drop-down' descriptions describing their function.According to Adobe's website, PhotoShop and PhotoShop Elements was designed to keep Adobe competative.Elements may have more features than the old versions of PhotoDeluxe, but figureing out how to use them has been a nighmare for me.So for the average user who wants to edit their family vacation photo's, I have but one thing to say, save your money.

299603," Decent Season - terrible finale!: Overall, Season three wasn't as strong as the first two. But what really disappointed was the 2-episode ""season finale"".

I won't use spoilers, but the entire road trip from Atlanta, ""interrogation"" of the prisoner, wiring of a criminal, stakeout and execution at the end (under a car - REALLY?), motivations of the parties involved - all rubbish and could never happen at any level of police work.

299606," Lovecraft scores over Holmes: A fantastic collection, thanks to editors Michael Reaves, and John Phelan.A great idea and the writers take up the challenge with gusto. Two of the best, The Case of the Antiquarian's Niece by Barbara Hambly, and A Case of Royal Blood are genuine pastiches. The problem is, believing that Holmes would countenance the supernatural in the solution of the cases. Mr. Doyle would have been delighted, especially in his later years, when he became a so called believer in the existence of the hereafter, spirits etc.The writers have carefully used Lovecraft's trade mark terms:'The Elders', 'The Necronomicon' and 'Cthulhu'. All enough to make the blood of his fans run faster.Sherlock Holmes fans should also rejoice, in the Weeping Masks, there are details of Watson's wounds received in Afganistan,not in Conan Doyle's accounts.

This didn't stop me from buying Mr. Razavi's ""Design of Analog CMOS ICs "" and I liked his tutorial in the IEEE Phase Lock Loop book he edited.I know he can do a better job.",__label__1 
299624," Fascinating Novelization of the End of the Ottomans: Princess is a well written novelization of the life of an Ottoman princess as she struggles to come to terms with exile, the West, and being alone in the world. The author is the Princess's daughter. As a Turkophyle I was fascinated by the details of life in Istanbul at the end of the Sultanate. It was also very interesting to see the politics of the era through Ottoman eyes...... very different from the history books. The princess is not always a sympathetic character, but you cannot help but feel her pain as her whole world is turned upside down. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the Middle East.",__label__2

But Grossman undermines this truth by filling his tale with propaganda, although he tries to overlay it with some realism about Stalin's rule. The propaganda is specially apparent in certain things Grossman describes the Germans as doing, but the Germans lost the war and the truth is still hidden by the lies that distort the history of any defeated nation.Grossman gives far too much space to ideology. Also, he could have given some credit to Russian spies instead of inflicting the reader with longueurs about German spies.Grossman's characters are shallow except for Grekov, who only makes a fleeting appearance. Maybe Grekov's name is due to the Greeks, the original democrats.In trying to give Grossman the benefit of the doubt, I forced myself to read the whole book. It wasn't worth it.

Sony's support site does state that it will not support Media Center 2005 unless preinstalled. Checked HP's site and updates available even on some much older models than the ""new"" R Seris.

There are a lot of electronic beats on this one, but he plays around them in fine fashion. ""Devil's Slide"" starts this one off and is a classic example of his ability to create exciting, original riffs. ""Borg Sex"" is a very playful number and is more electronic-oriented, but very enjoyable just the same. ""Attack"" is a very cool song that hearkens back to the good old days of shred. ""Clouds Race Across the Sky"" is another in his famous repetoire of beautiful, slower numbers and has a great ambient feeling to it. Overall, this is definitely not his best work, but very worthy of praise as it can easily blow away most music that is out there today. As a side point, this is a great album for fans of the band Praxis, as it provides a good balance of good-old shred and thumping beats. Listen to this one a few times and it will grow on you. I guarantee.",__label__2

The second time I jumped around reading different chapters based on mood and interest.

I loved her simpleness, her relationship with her family, and mostly I loved her ability to keep things going for her children. She was able to admit to being totally confused and at the same time she managed to figure out who she was. I loved all the characters in the book, even the ornery ones turned out to be good people. Charlene's father was so well written, I could see him in my mind and hear his voice.He is a character I will long remember. This was a book full of love and laughter,and a book that is simply the story of the lives of those living in a small community who stick together when they need to.

Some of the photos were not very flattering (and sometimes rather funny) for the subject and, in a sense, I felt as if I was intruding on their privacy, as they did not always know that they were being recorded.

It is a solid pan with a great non-stick coating-- a droplet of oil (from the brownie batter) sat on the top of an edge for days, which was amazing. Pan comes with a nice, plastic spatula which is just the right size for the narrow rows of brownie and easy on the coating of the pan.Even a less than enthusiastic lover of brownie edges can appreciate the novelty of this pan.Good value for the money (paid about 30$).",__label__2

Holmes' profile before (not sure where, but I have his information in my brain somehow) so this documentary inevitably intrigued me.It's pretty good, not all that. Not very gruesome, so it's bearable. I found it boring at times because of the lack of gore and because the guy who narrates the film is extremely monotone and snooze worthy...but overall it was a very informative chunk of history.

With such a wealth of fascinating information available (court transcripts, etc) do we really need filler footage of some faceless actress wandering down dark hallways acting frightened? This man killed countless people and yet the producers of this documentary thought so little of their audience that they hired a narrator who sounds as if he is the chief ride operator of the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland.

Kind of like Cobain, but different, more East Coast street smart and savvy. The band had some commercial success, most of which is showcased on this fine collection.

Susan is a strong and determined character, and I would be interested in reading more novels featuring her.I didn't know much about the situation in Somalia before reading this book, but the author has worked there, and her knowledge of Mogadishu comes through on every page to make the story feel realistic.

It's perhaps the most essential of her post-SMILE studio albums, as it's the final one of her career, not counting the 2-disc STONED SOUL PICNIC collection. Some of Laura's most soulful vocals and songwriting are here, on tracks like ""A Woman of the World"" and ""Art of Love"". ""Louise Chuch"", Laura's rollicking tribute to women artists, is another highlight. And the closing track, a cover of ""Dedicated to the One I Love"", has to be counted among the most beautifully sung performances of her career. It demonstrates how much Laura had grown as a singer and interpreter since her whole album of covers, GONNA TAKE A MIRACLE, was released two decades earlier.

The latter comes only from satipatthana vipassana, as explained in the Maha-Satipatthana Sutra.

The special effects are abysmal and consistant mostly of a large man in a latex and white fur ape suit. There is some very low end CGI which appears to have been added as an after thought.The best scene involves Peter DeLouise being tackled by a Yeti and then beaten with his own leg before the Yeti takes a bite of it.It's a sad sad attempt at a horror movie but funnier then most bad horror movies.

For example, pay yourself first is still a very important concept but the advice on where to invest is almost comical given the recent upheaval. Additionally, many of the economic assumptions are flawed. Nearly all the examples on savings, investment, and compound interest assume a 10-15% return on investment. Who, besides the credit card companies, actually gets that kind of return anymore? Of course hindsight is 20/20, but that same hindsight could be used to rewrite the financial sections -- which is sorely needed.So personally I highly recommend this book, but advise that you supplement the financial advice with more recent sources.",__label__2

299910, too small: Sent it back. There were no dimensions listed and it turns out the roll is VERY tiny: only 3/4 in. wide and 3/4 in. tall. The size makes it unrealistic looking and the $3.95 price tag is too much. The roll from Plan Toys is a more realistic 2 1/4 in. by 3/4 in.,__label__1 
299911, The drag of all times: I came to this Opera through sort of a back door. I was watching a documentary on Maria Callas. And several times he mentioned that she played Norma. Somehow I had overlooked this Opera so I thought I would catch up. This was the only version that was readily available I thought Norma is Norma is Norma.I can see now that I made a small mistake. In general I don't like things that are in modern dress. But again I thought normal is Norma was Norma. I waited for them speak when they did I sort of wish they didn't. I have to confess I was using English subtitles. The production never got any better. It just drag on and on and on.One day I hope to look at a different version and see what it is that Norma that makes it a classic as this version was the drag of all times.,__label__1 
299912," Norma-----------NOT!: Avoid this ridiculous ""Concept"" Norma at all costs, unless you want to plunk down nearly $40.00 for what is the most tired, trite staging of this magnificent opera I have ever seen. Don't the Euro-Trash directors have any new ideas? More of the same old 1950 period costumes with Norma making an entrance dressed like Norma Desmond with a turban and sunglasses, signing autographs for the Druid chorus.The stage business is completely ludicrous, and reduces the magnificent music to a meaningless side show.The cast all have beautiful voices and certainly deserve a better staging than this psuedo-arty nightmare..Patrick C.

299913," Timeless Jazz: Excellent recording by this talented group of all-stars. Recorded in 1990, this is the fourth and final CD by this quintet. With Bobby Hutcherson on Vibes, Harold Land on Sax, Cedar Walton on Piano, Billy Higgins on drums, Buster Williams on Bass and Steve Turre on Trombone it is difficult to go wrong. All five are leaders in their own right. This recording features compositions by all members of the group except Higgins. The music is hard bop/post bop. Solos are delivered with the grace and intelligence one would expect from musicians of this caliper. I believe this is also the final pairing of Bobby Hutcherson and Harold Land, who together produced some of the finest hard bop recordings you will ever find. I highly recommend any of the late 60's Blue Note recordings that feature these two great artists. If you are a fan of Bobby Hutcherson, Harold Land or Cedar Walton I recommend all four of the recordings by this group if you can find them.",__label__2

Instead I find it helps one hear the cadences in writing through Bach's many different tempos, rhythms, beats and notes that form a unified symmetry interpreted, here, by Gould's genius.

It is heavy at 5lbs and after taking a few hours of snapshots you get to wish you had a lighter lens. The quality of the photos is amazing though. It may not be as sharp as the newest Canon 24-105mm but it's up there with the L lens professional quality you want. Much much better than my yellow band 28-105mm but the price is lifting and lugging this moster around to get better photos. If you can only take one lens for 10 days, this is the only one you need. No image stabilization so you have to crank your ISO way up to get good results and no shake, I learned that the hard way.

This can be somewhat annoying because the cord will bulge out in front of me or to the side and stay in that position until I get inside.

I immediately bought five pairs off Amazon, just in case they ever discontinue them.With regards to sound quality, I'm not really an audiophile so I don't feel qualified to comment much. My normal pair of headphones at home are a mid-range pair of open-air, circum-aural Sennheisers, so it's difficult to compare the two.

If yours were great, I am glad that you may have been lucky enough to have a non-defective pair. If not for their falling into disrepair, I would've been happy with them. However, even when they were good, I wished that they had greater ability to block out other sound. Because they fit loosely in the ear, other sounds can easily penetrate.

We have an old ball that we use to play with during our sand volleyball days that we loved and this ball was much smaller than our old ball. It's not as soft as I thought it would be but that may also be because it is still new. Anyway, I gave it a 2 because I felt it was too hard and smaller than a normal or standard size vball. It was just ""OK""",__label__1 
299978," Great Rope albeit not easy to shorten: Great rope, comfortable handles, however, shortening the rope is very difficult because it requires special pliers to compress the e-clips that retain the bearings into the handle. Then, the exposed rope end is held in place with a crimped sheet steel retainer that is very difficult to enlarge and free the rope end. Then, after shortening the rope, you have to re-crimp the deformed retainer and struggle to compress the e-clip bearing retainer back into the handle. Seems to me that for fifty-cents more, everlast could have used the threaded brass collar rope retainer that Reeebok uses and made it signifcantly easier for the consumer to be able to customize the rope length albeit not much easier to remove the e-clip retainers though.",__label__2 
299979," Tears Of Fire: This is an excellent retrospective of Tammy's career. Among the more than 50 tracks are over twenty of her biggest hits, but it's not just a greatest hits collection. There are a few of her duets with George Jones, but that's not the focus of this release. Coming out in 1992, there are three previously unreleased tracks and many little known gems. The songs are nearly evenly distributed among the years, starting with her first hit ""Apartment #9"" in 1967 through three songs recorded in 1990-91. If you're just looking for the hits, there may be a better collection, but if you're a Tammy Wynette fan, this is indispensable. One of the highlights for me is her version of Mickey Newbury's ""Poison Red Berries"" from 1974, here still known by it's original name ""I Don't Think About Him No More"".",__label__2

But, I figured it wouldn't affect the way the vacuum worked, so I kept it.The first time I used it, I was impressed. It did a nice job and the 'dirtfinder' was a great added feature. However, when I emptied it, I immediately realized it was not going to be a great appliance - like the other reviewer said, it's a mess. It takes 20 minutes to vacuum and 10 minutes to clean up - the filter, screen, vacuum, dust cup are all impossible to clean completely.It's going back to the shop again and will be given away when it's fixed.

The second time I vacuumed my carpet and it did a wonderful job, but I used the hand tools and because the agitator still runs during this time, the belt broke and melted all the plastic and part of the bristles to the brush, I had bits of burnt plastic imbeded in the carpet where it was sitting. I call the warranty dept. and they said because it tells you in the hand book that the agitator still runs while using the hand tools that it was NOT covered. So why have the hand tool attachments if you can't use them? I do NOT recommed this item for that simple fact.

I wish I would have known all this before I bought it a year ago. Belts pop off, hose pops out while you're vacuuming, it's VERY noisy, it's VERY messy to empty the canister/filters (all that dust gets back into the air!), and the hard floor setting spits dirt back at you instead of sucking. I am very disappointed in this vacuum. Not what I would have expected from a Hoover. Probably the most annoying thing about this vacuum is the noise. I can't wait to find a vacuum that is QUIET and easy to maintain so vacuuming becomes fun again.",__label__1

299989," delicious: I initially heard these organ concertos on YouTube a mere two weeks ago and they were a revelation: virtuoso organ without liturgical associations and Handel at his most playful, occasionally even frolicsome. Ton Koopman and the ensemble understand the scale and decorousness of the baroque at the same time as the uses to which these compositions were put, i.e. interludes for the more portentous oratorios. Accordingly Koopman's formidable skill allows the sometimes demanding passages to sound light and joyous. The audio engineeering is crisp and brings out the lush mix of timbres, of brass and strings with the organ, in all its variety of stops. I can no longer say that Bach is unequalled where organ is concerned; I doubt that I'll ever tire of these Handel gems.",__label__2

The amount of fabric needed was written but not the amount of basting tape or the amount of the interfacing, which irked me a bit. After a bad experience with the ill-informed employees at Joann's I was ready to start on the project. After everything there wasn't enough fabric, which could totally be the fault of the incompetent Joann's employees, and not the books.

It was easy to determine in the shop where I purchased it that it was an easy read: furthermore it was bargain priced. I am surprised however that there is no mention of the mathematician Euclid whose famous work helped to shape future mathematical reasoning for centuries. His fifth postulate, in one form or another, is known by most people with a reasonable high school education and commanded the attention of many future, famous mathmaticians.

In the same category as Attack of the Killer Tomatoes (only apparently with a much lower budget), TDC looks like it was made with love and shoestrings - and a chicken puppet. And some ketchup. And a twelve-year-old with a computer. Anyhow, if you're willing not to take it seriously and just go for the laughs, it's great. The actress who plays Mascara (I'm guessing that's Thirtina O'Blivion?) is terrific, totally chews up the scenery, and you can't help but root for the tough redneck girl who won't let the devil loose in her little town. If you have an hour to kill and flexible expectations, then this might just be the movie for you!",__label__2 
300041," for busy parents with short attention span ?: This book is not very well-written, and a lot of what is said is actually common sense. It feels watered-down and rush, although I believed it was intended for busy readers for a quick reference.

300042," Beware Tracking Problems and Out of Date POIs: I bought this unit in anticipation of using it with my laptop on a long road trip. The software loaded fine and worked with the GPS receiver included with it. While using it a few times, however, I've found some serious limitations. First, the user interface is completely unique and requires some getting used to - it's not really bad but I'm the only one in my family that's taken the time to figure it out. Second, the points-of-interest (POIs), like gas stations, restaurants, etc., are very sparse and out-of-date. Third, and perhaps most disturbing, is that the GPS receiver loses lock on the GPS satellite signals in overcast skies. This might not matter if you're cruising along on a highway, but not when your trying to find your next turn. For these reasons, I recommend looking elsewhere for a laptop-based GPS unit.",__label__1

Even though on the box they show the original style pen, the pens inside are now changed to the 70% recycled material version). There is nothing wrong with the new pen appearance. The major flaw is now the new ink is much lighter blue.

300045," very good for modelers: I ordered this book in Amazon and I had no expectations at all. I was just sort of collecting all the information I can about the British Challenger MBT since I have my Tamiya kit crying to be built. The book starts with some pictures of early Challenger prototypes and a couple of assembly line factory pics as well, also interior views including two where the personal is loading the monster's main gun. There are some pictures of the variants too, the Challenger Training Tank (2), the Challenger with the Mine Plough (1) and the Repair & Recovery Vehicle (9). The other 90% are open pics of the tank (very good ones) with detailed information, including campaigns in The Gulf and Bosnia. Also there is the history of the development of the tank and its versions, although I think the Concord's Challenger 1 & 2 is much better in this subject. Finally, the last five pages are dedicated to the Challenger 2. I've bought four books from Europa Militaria...so far, so good.",__label__2

The author gives the reader a lot of information and understanding of Manet, his family and the other artists of the times.

Of course this was an important influence on Paris and its inhabitants, but perhaps too much space and time given to this subject.",__label__2

London's complete ""Julie Is Her Name"" sessions ... Includes numerous bonus tracks ...These so-called ""bonus tracks"" are certainly NOT taken from London's 1955 debut recording sessions - they are merely tracks lifted from London's albums ""Lonely Girl"" (1956), ""Calender Girl"" (1956), ""Julie"" (1957), and ""Julie Is Her Name -Vol. 2"" (1958).To make matters worse the album's producers have given some of the tracks a horrible ""fake stereo"" do-over (I could do better with my at-home software). Interestingly, these tracks are the ones that have, to date, only been officialy relased on disc by EMI in mono, which is proof enough that this album is unauthorized bootleg.A waste of time and money.",__label__1

The songs are all taken from her first two studio albums *her self-titled debut and ""Emotions""* with an added bonus of her great cover of ""I'll Be There."" Mariah's crowning acheivement on here is ""Emotions"" which is probably one of the most vocally challenging songs of all time and Mariah nails it. Other highlights are ""Can't Let Go"" and ""Vision of Love."" My only complaint is I really wish she would've performed ""I Don't Wanna Cry"" and/or ""Love Takes Time.""

The colors are wonderfully vivid too. The only thing I'm disappointed in is the fact that many of them are so sloppily glued - which seems to be a trend I'm seeing in Haba's toys lately. The pieces are in place properly, they just looks like a machine squirted too much glue between them and no one double checked to see how the finished product looked. Lots of dried glue protruding out from between the pieces. It seems to me that Haba used to pay more attention to how their toys were assembled before putting them on the shelves (or shipping them out, in this case).",__label__2

(except for the one that is not published in English) I generally find her novels interesting in that they manage to take snippets from history and make it real through the characters. The Serpent Garden has a light humour that endears the main character to me. It wasn't easy for a ""paintrix"" to make a living for herself and Susanna Dallet does it with a tongue in cheek sense of humour and practicality that makes her more real than fiction. The angel Hadriel adds his own delightful opionions on the heavenly heirarchy that makes the reader giggle guiltily.

I have tried many different gentle cleaning methods and run several changes of water through the kettle, but each time there are tiny bits of metal in the water, sometimes more, sometimes less.

Regrettably our new one (received it around Thanksgiving) has somewhat unreliable whistling behavior -- if it's full, it whistles. Not full, and it can reach and sustain a rolling boil without making enough sound. Over time this seems to have improved and may be due to an insufficiently snug closure of the hinged spout cap (a weak point as noted above). Love how it looks, though.",__label__2

Robert Culp plays an American physicist chosen to be the ""scarecrow"" used to frighten the world powers away from war between themselves. Through an agonizing series of operations he is gradually transformed into a hideous version of an alien and sent up in orbit to pretend to be arriving from outer space. The combination of script, acting, terrific lighting and direction, and the really wonderful musical score make this episode an unforgetable emotional experience.

The reader is at once propelled into a non-stop, exciting trek of a lifetime from England's green and pleasant land, to the seemingly endless fields of gold in the heart of the Canadian prairie. Then, as if swept up by magic carpet, you head into the dripping Amazonian jungle, only to wind up in the dusty Himalayan foothills! Not only do we get to travel along with this amiable, one-of-a-kind animal doc, we get to meet his four-legged patients and an interesting collage of collegues, too! This book is no run-of-the-mill autobiography. It's one to read by the fireside as the chill winds of winter roar outside your door, or while reclining on a sunny beach in holiday heaven.

Melancholies for example are never satisfied and can overcome this weakness with a life of heartfelt thanksgiving. The strength of Megan Melancholy is her incredible self discipline.

If I try to put the lid on so that it seems more airtight, it gets hard to get it off. Not a good thing when you're often in the middle of cooking and are trying to get the scraps out of the way fast. I'm going to look for a large plastic container to take its place.

300129," A cleaner sound than Oh, Inverted World - very strong album!: The Shins - a wonderful band with two great albums under their belts. This is their second record, and in many ways it is stronger than their first. It's more diverse and the production is of a different style - where as Oh, Inverted World had that recognizable 60's pop aesthetic - this album is a bit cleaner sounding. Personally, I think I prefer the first album, though this album is great too - get them both! If you can, find the vinyl for this album - it's translucent red, really cool!",__label__2 
300130," Superb from start to finish!: i cannot put into words how much i enjoy this cd. i purchased their first album "" oh inverted world."" and really liked them. but this beats that out a million times over. every song is a complete gem in its very own right. from the istantly catchy ""turn a square"" to the almost haunting ""pink bullets"" it grabs hold and won't let go until the last track ends and you hit replay. the only shortcoming i can see with this cd is that it leaves me longing for more than ten masterful tracks. a gorgeous piece of work. well done guys!! can't wait for the next run!",__label__2 
300131," My favorite album of last year: I have to admit, I ""discovered"" the Shins through the Garden State soundtrack, but wow, am I glad I did! I haven't heard an album in probably five years with a track lineup as strong as ""Chutes Too Narrow"". The diversity of styles from one track to the next is really astounding, and they execute them all so convincingly!

The authur constantly repeated things, trying to make the book longer. Plus Tucker seems to have a grudge against Joshua Chamberlain. In the last chapter he makes it sound like Chamberlain had nothing to do with the battle and lied about his contribution afterwards. He provdes no maps to prove his ""research"". He also states the 15th Alabama retired up Big Round Top after the battle. But wasn't Big Round Top in Union hands after the 2nd day? There's many things I didn't like about this book.",__label__1 
300138," A Huge Disapointment: This book was a huge disapointment. The author repeats his self over and over through out the book. He makes broad assumptions about the commanders, units and men with no facts to back up his assumption. The total lack of maps make the action hard to follow. His view that a few more men to one regiment would have turned the battle is absurb. There were many other factors in play that could or couldn't have swayed the tide of the battle. And his support of the ragged rebel myth is a huge distraction as it's repeated just about once a page. There were times the Southern troops were ragged and other than shoes (which this was a factor for both sides in this campaign) this wasn't one of them.

This one is a travesty; an album so bad, so melodically vacuous, so uninspired and derivative, it deserves a special place in the pantheon of bad Christmas music (or the trash can, take your choice). Hear Neil ""Three Note"" Diamond savagely butcher such standards as Silent Night and The Christmas Song. Hear John Lennon spin in his grave as Neil treats Happy Christmas (War is Over) with all the delicacy and grace of a charging rhinocerous. And let's not forget that virtual note-for-note rip-off of Bruce Springsteen's Santa Claus is Comin' to Town.

I looked at my mom and she looked at me, and we both said this is garbage! I don't mind him being a jew and singing Christmas songs, if he could sing them correctly, but this is totally ridiculous. Hey ""Gretlcello"" I like your taste in cello and classical music. I'm not a cello player, but I like recordings of the instrument, and you have really good taste, but stop listening to Josh Groban and Kenny G! Okay! I guess we're the only ones who know that you should stay away from Christmas albums by Mr.Diamond.P.S.

The episodes that ARE strong may be the strongest of the series, but unfortunately are not as plentiful as in previous seasons.

300181," One of my favorite CDs: You know, sometimes i like to go and look at the 1 star reviews of CDs i own and many times it makes me laugh. The ones i'm reading here are downright hilarious. It's mostly conservative people accusing them of being communist/anarchists/aetheists etc. For those who are saying they suck because they were a sell-outs for using a corporate giant you need to think about it before calling them that. One of the simplist ways of getting your message accross nowadays is music, the bigger the label the better, that way your message gets out to millions of people. They weren't selling-out, they were being smart. True, if your views are more conservative you'll hate the lyrics that Zach has written. However, if you don't care about the views in the lyrics, or believe in what he says, than it's a good cd overall.Favorite Tracks: Bombtrack, Township Rebellion, Freedom, Wake Up",__label__2 
300182," This is the best ever recorded: I'm a huge fan of all Rage records but this one top all his followers. Its pure energy. Zack de la Rocha raps with the fury and such anger I'ver never seen before. And unlike many others singers in this genre(Limb Bizkit)his lyrics really mean something. Tom Morello makes some of the sickest sounds ever made by a guitar and the rythem-section(Timmy C. and Brad Wilk) make Rage the most powerful band ever.'Bullet in the head' starts of with a funky bass line and explodes in the end with Zak chanting ""A bullet in the head"". My favourites are 'Take the power back','Wake Up' and 'Freedom' although i must say that all tracks are simply amazing. Their political oppinion can be clearly seen and even if you do not agree with them you have to admit that they do something for their believes.

The most disturbing theme of the book is all the children who in some way or another, get in the way of their parents' relationship because of their strangeness. The title poem: ""The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy,"" exemplifies this. In this twisted poem with it's frightening black and white pictures, a father barbarically devours his oyster-like child to gain more sexual prowess. I would recommend this book only to people who enjoy Burton's darker movies and his theme of being a misfit, to other people, the poems might seem strangely cruel, and the world outlook would seem dark and pessimistic.",__label__2

I'd be afraid it'd snap like a rubber band if I ever really put it to the stretch test.As it is, every time I pull more than 10' out of this hose, the windtunnel upright falls over and makes such a loud KERPLOP that it scares me out of my wits. Doesn't matter which direction the windtunnel is facing, one yank on the hose and the vacuum falls over like a drunken sailor (but makes much more noise).In short, I've had this hose for about nine years and it's sturdy and strong and useful but it doesn't provide a true 20' of usable length.

In dungeons, you don't want to fight because you will be weaker when you find the boss. On the world map, you love random battles because they let you increase both your overall level and your job level while gaining money. The boss battles are difficult (I fought each one at least two times) while being similar to each other.<The bad>: The save system. It is pratically nonexistant in the dungeons.

But compare that to what you get on Moviola. The Midnight Cowboy is rendered hauntingly and beautifully in full orchestra with the harmonica echoing the original movie soundtrack version.

My husband, who drinks caffeinated coffee, quite enjoys their ""bold"" coffee pods. In the meanwhile, I circumvent the problem by using two decaf coffee pods, while selecting the one cup option. It concentrates the coffee, which significantly improves the flavor. It bothers me, though, that I'm paying ""twice"" for one cup of coffee.From the reviews, it seems like a lot of people enjoy the decaf coffee, as it is. However, if you enjoy a more intense, bold tasting coffee, you will need to use two pods to get some approximation of a distinct coffee flavor.",__label__1

His new object of desire is not much better - she spits venom at her college-age children for staying with their father in the town where they had grown up.

I like how Howard Stern & Jerry Springer are taken to task for crass content and then his entire entry under Courtney Love is ""HO"".

It took me about 30 minutes and a cup of coffee to breeze my way through most of it -- there is just nothing here but a few paragraphs of sniping on each of a cast of activist liberals, with a few hollywood types and token deranged conservatives thrown in (the latter just to make the point that while all lefties are extremists, only a few on the right are and Goldberg is happy to offer them up). I'll admit some of it was marginally fun to read, but it has all the intellectual depth of an Archie comic.

He's completely entitled to his opinion, but he doesn't even really clarify how a lot of these people are screwing up America (e.g. Courtney Love: HO).

He's figured out that there are a million people out there who will buy any book that unilaterally supports their point of view and that in no way tries to provide context or perspective.

We, as a country, are way too focused on OTHER countries. Not fixing our own country. We spend way to much time and money on OTHER countries, and we can't blame liberals for that.

This man needs help. He also shows how dementedly unhip he is about a culture he's writing about by making the claim that Barbra Streisand matters anymore to, well, anyone. I certainly can't think of anyone who's ever cared about her politics, one way or another. Goldberg knows as much about the current culture as the typical cranky old man screaming at kids to get off his lawn.

But, no other album has been able to make such loud noise rock (songs like ""Blood"") mix with softer songs (like ""Daughter"") so well.

The result of the band's experimentation (for lack of a better word) is an exceedingly listenable record. Out of Pearl Jams five studio albums todate, Vs. has some of the most artful tracks, including ""Indifference"" and ""Elderly Woman...""

I prefer sharper crisp violin tone, as this one had more of a lulling gypsy esq sound. Chopin himself later wrote he should have written the violin part for the viola, maybe this is why it doesn't work well to me.

Also, what the hell were they thinking requiring the camera to be in self timer mode, especially when self timer mode times out in a minute or two? When trying to wrangle a large group of people to pose for a shot, it can easily take longer than the time limit before it kicks back over to regular shooting mode.I was delighted with this product when i first received it and played around with a few self portraits, but after a few months of frustration, have completely abandoned it in favor of the wired remote.",__label__1

If you learn to work around this little problem, the product does work fine, to the front and off to the side. That has always annoyed me however. On the plus side, it is still on its first batteries after all these years and it is still working as good as new. It also does work with the new XTI. A freind of mine has 2 XTIs so we tried it on one of them. he bought a wire remote instead. It's not really the units fault, it's just where the eye on the camera is.Update February 2010, it is still working on the battery it came with.",__label__2

They are not huge, like the ones you might find in a large commercial laundry, but are well made and sturdy enough to take the abuse they will be subject to. Especially handy is the hanging rack to keep wrinkles to a minimum or hang dry items. I also put a couple in my home basement laundry, because the laundry (10) baskets kept stacking up in my teens rooms. This cart stays where it belongs! The height of the basket is perfect for scooping laundry out of a front load washer right into the basket. Also, the price cannot be beat and Amazon's free shipping made these quite a bargain compared to other site's price with shipping, it's heavy so the shipping would have been about $20. at least.",__label__2

The primary reason I purchased this album was for ""Lush Life"", the great song composed by Billy Strayhorn, who worked closely with Duke Ellington.Queen Latifah has a voice with the range and control to bring out all the subtle tonalities of this song which many vocalists find too difficult to perform the way it should be done. Even Linda Ronstadt, who I admire greatly for her talent, can't compare with Queen Latifah in the delivery of this song.I recommend this album highly.",__label__2

All I can say is, ""Dana, bring it on!""",__label__2

THe album is fantastic the recording is ""raw"" and in the sense its not over produced.. the vocals are clear and the Queen mixes well with this style.. in fact after hearing this album she should have been doing this all along.. I hope it dosent stop here because there is a clear talent in this area.. not to take away from any of her prior success but I was truly impressed. THe instruments through out the entire album are another striking point... especially the drums.. great dynamic and a ""wide"" open sound with the whole band... if you love Jazz if you love moody music and dynamic music this will be a purchase you wont regret.",__label__2

But this cd ""ain't"" it. Although I was blown away by the rendition of Al Green's ""Simply Beautiful"" which the Queen and Al Green himself crooned out together, I couldn't quite digest the other selections.

Anyway if you're looking for some music that is well produced, and if you're a Queen Latifah fan, buy it anyway because she is so talented, and she is one of the few rapper artist that can sing. She has a real nice smooth voice. The track with her and Al green I reccommend., and of course the classic ""Hello Stranger"" originally recorded by Barbara Lewis in the 60's. This was and still is a beautiful song. Dana Owens aka Queen Latifah does a nice cover of this song, if you don't have this cd go out and buy it today.",__label__2

Here, she combined the perfect balance of melody and soul to create one of the best pop singles every written - Dreamlover. Now, she's got waaay too much soul and not enough melody.In contrast to the high spirit of Dreamlover, the remaining tracks on this album that never made it to the radio waves are incredibly deep and filled with the misery in getting over a loved one - Music Box, Now That I Know, Never Forget You (go Babyface!!!!), Just to Hold You Once Again, and All I've Ever Wanted.

It seems that depending upon individual circumstances human beings can run the gamut of emotions and be attentive or uncaring and uncompromising. The narrative style was very interesting. Mr. Kamau's humor and style of communicating feelings of faith, love, optimism, and enthusiasm leads to an enthralling read. The Tender Warriors Book Club rates Pictures of a Dying Man a must read.",__label__2 
300470," Not happy with this shaver at all: I owned an older model Remington three head shaver for about 2 years before I bought this one. It always gave me a close shave without having to make multiple passes or contort my face.But I dropped it a few times and cracked the plastic head for it which I couldn't find a replacement for. So I upgraded and paid over $100 for what I thought was a quality electric shaver.I am very disappointed with this shaver. I can get a close shave with it, but I have to go over the same spot 5 to 6 times to get it smooth even after the so called ""two week"" waiting period. I just purchased the new Remington Titanium self cleaning model as I feel it will work much better, judged by the performance of my older Remington. I gave it two stars only because the flip up shaver works well.If you've owned a Norelco in the past and have had good experience with it stay with Norelco, otherwise, I'd recommend Remington any day.",__label__1

A careful reconstruction of a life, with logical extrapolation of missing points and a compelling analysis of historical inconsistencies in this unique figure. I especially appreciated the author's relative absence from the narrative (i.e., he was not telling us constantly how he felt about the facts of the biography). Gratefully, he did not editorialize about the biographies central issue: Tchaikovsky's homosexuality. The issue too often derails serious historical research, either to condemn or to convert to the cause. A sheer delight of a read.",__label__2

I purchased the ""Hill Dark Rosin"" and when I applied the rosin the first time I already was able to tell the difference. Each stroke of the bow on the rosin revealed marks on the rosin which means it was applying. The starter rosin never got marked up. After about 8 strokes of this rosin I was able to play the violin with a much better tone, and lots of less scratching. After this experience, I highly recommend this brand and type of rosin.

True, this book was inspired by Comet Hale-Bopp, which has come and gone, but it's really about comets in general--only three of the fifteen chapters are about Hale-Bopp--so this book is still worth reading. The author discusses what comets are, how comets have figured in history, how they form, and the wonders of great comets like Halley's . The author has a lively, friendly style that readily communicates his enthusiasm for the subject. That, plus the clear and substantial writing, make this book a joy to read. He does for comets what Ken Croswell's book PLANET QUEST does for extrasolar planets. Highly recommended--even if you can't see Hale-Bopp any more.",__label__2

I thought I would be clever and buy another manufacturer's vacuum-trimmer in a brick-and-mortar store. It was awful. The vacuum barely worked and if I didn't hold the trimmer perfectly aligned with your face the cut was very uneven. I returned it and bought the Norelco T990 from Amazon. It is fantastic! The flexing head of the trimmer means that I get an even trim every time, no matter what angle I hold the trimmer. Its so reliable that I don't really even need to use a mirror. I really like the charge indicator as well. I don't have to guess if its time to charge the trimmer. The pop-up trimmer isn't the best or most convenient, and the ""deluxe"" case isn't as deluxe as it sounds. However, those are minor gripes. Overall, this is an excellent beard trimmer.",__label__2

I've always loved Norelco shavers and have used them for about 28 years and have never, ever had even a slight problem with them. When I first started using this model I thought I wasn't going to like it at all because it was shaving much worse than my previous model. To my amazement, after the approximate ""two week"" break in period it started shaving even closer than my previous model. If it weren't for the battery I would have given this 5 stars.

The touted ""history"" section is a mind-numbing rush through the past - only a segway to what seem to be paid avertisements for the newest casinos. The images from the history are still photos which appear so briefly that you can barely tell what they are. The modern day material (which is actually what I wanted to see) is so poorly shot that you rarely get a full view. A close-up shot of some lion-head fountain hardly represents the scale and grandor of these amazing resorts/hotels.

Still not too bad until you turn it on and that terrific suction adheres the front of the vacuum to the carpet. It did a great job cleaning, but my arm was sore after doing half a room. There is no way that I could vacuum a whole house using this thing. We have dense pile carpet; perhaps there is less drag on a Berber or loop type carpet. It's a real shame, because I love the looks, quality of construction, and design of the hose and attachments, but bottom line: if I can't push it across the floor, all the great features in the world aren't going to make it an acceptable product.",__label__1

Its not really a decorating book either - its focus is substantially on replicating the look of some of the material (pottery, fabrics, etc) through do-it-yourself crafts.

Its a brilliant piece of work and I hope the author continues the series to cover passed pawns,doubled pawns etc. The only way i would advise anyone below ELO 2000 to buy this book is to use it as a game reference with your opening book. You would need to play one of the following openings Caro Kan, Queens Gambit, the Nimzo Indian defense or the French defense. It makes you realise that the Isolated pawn is a great source of strength or a fundamental weakness and occurs a lot in certain types of openings.

300531," Elvis at His Best!: If you want one DVD for your collection pick this one up as The King is at the top with his band in beautiful Hawaii. There is a well chosen concert selection of his love ballads,hits, and prime rock & roll choices for all. The crowd really is in to the concert and Elvis is the only true King of Rock & Roll. The DVD is crisp with excellant camera angles and a top notch soundtrack from a recording that is over 25 years old. A great job was done remastering from the orginal tapes. Sit back ,relax and enjoy but you most likely will be dancing and singing along! I know I did!",__label__2 
300532," Take the Rose Colored Glasses off: Everything said about the excellent quality sound and picture quality is correct. Everything said about this being Elvis at his best is not. This is his worst performance at a time when he could have consolidated and increased his fan base substantially, given the exposure this special received.The closest we get to getting the ""real"" Elvis is in his performance of Fever. I'll Remember you is excellent.In reference to the few of his earlier hits, Elvis clearly gives his fans ""the finger"" - that is, "" I really don't want to be singing this stuff"".The cameras move more than he does (if he moves at all). Elvis seems content to just sleepwalk through the whole show, and given this historic performance, this is tragic.I've been a fan sinceI was about 5 years old, so of course I have bought the DVD. But, from an Elvis performace perspective, the show was a dud. Even the 1977 CBS TV special had more energy than this.",__label__1

Senseless death is something none of us has any control over and all we can do is deal with the aftermath as best we can. A young boy in his freshman year of college has an emotional meltdown and kills several students and instructors at his college then turns the gun on himself. Everyone is stunned, including his parents. Why did he do it? There are no easy answers. Was there something his parents did wrong in his upbringing? His parents, portrayed by Michael Sheen and Maria Bello, struggle to not only hang on to the love they had for their son but for each other. Their marriage, which was already shaky before this crisis, is now in ruins. All of the actors gave powerful performances that rang true and old softie that I am, I was already moist-eyed fifteen minutes into the film. I'd also like to note that Alan Tudyk was wonderful as the brother of Maria Bello's character.",__label__2

I like cheap little horror movies if they can at least deliver some thrills, but Jack-O is just a waste of time from the beginning to the end. But what is really detestable is that they put in some material featuring John Carradine who died years before Jack-O was made, and then use another guy for the wide shots. How stupid do those guys think the audience is? Next time producer Fred Olen Ray (Beverly Hills Vamp) should direct himself, and not the obviously untalented Steve Latshaw. I'd recommend every horror fan to stay away from this waste of celluloid.",__label__1

If you are a collector of old records and early phonographs I suggest buying this book which can be obtained very economically AND also buying a copy of Roland Gelatts ""The Fabulous Phonograph"". The first is an unequaled source on the musical eras of America. The second book tells the story of the machines that played that music.The book starts with the early days of recorded sound and brings the reader forward in time all the way to the creation of The CD. It is a fairly easy read but definately a reference book containing VERY detailed histories of the music industry, technologies and audiences.For me this book is important as a valuable resource that focuses on many aspects of the history of music not covered by ""The Fabulous Phonograph"".

300573," Major Disappointment: This CD was a major disappointment. J Moss is a talented singer but this CD serves as a major example when Gospel music crosses the line of ministry and has become too worldly. First off, why is this man flaunting a gold and diamond encrusted cross on the cover like Bishop Don Juan ( a well known pimp)? What message is that sending to our children? Where is the humility?Secondly, the music is wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too contemporary and I like contemporary gospel but this isn't gospel music in my book. This is R & B music with a few ""Jesus"" shout outs. I loved J's first CD but I don't know where are the roots of the ministry in these songs? There are a few songs on here that show the potential of what a great CD this could have been but everytime you start to ""feel"" then another hip hop song comes along and snaps you out of it.I gave my CD away to a friend and 3 days later she gave it back and now it's gathering dust.",__label__1

This is spectacular electric funky jazz that can make a dead dance! Spectacular solos all around from every cat in the band. Incredible time from all the musicians. Interaction is really good.

Thankfully, Amazon allowed me to return the product. Overall, the experience was very frustrating and costly. I paid a 20% re-stocking fee because I did not return it within 30 days and I paid $188 for XP. As a final note, I find XP to be considerably more cumbersome than the Windows 2000 I replaced.

I attended the concert where ""Gary Glitter's Gangshow - The Gang, The Band, The Leader"" was recorded. One of the best, if not the best, live performance and shows ever. His songs were somewhat unique and looking over the titles with hindsight ie 'Do You Want To Touch Me', 'Angel Face' and 'Rock Hard Men', they look mighty suspicious.Gary sure looked creepy but I liked his sound.This is a good collection and a must have if you like his stuff.

The book also helped me to reverse the bad sleep habits that my 2 & 3/4 year old had gotten into. I now can put three children to bed early and enjoy a relaxing evening, knowing that they are getting the rest they need. If you're afraid of letting your child cry (as I did), please read this book. It explains exactly what the consequences of the crying-it-out method are, backing it all up with the latest scientific studies. This book is so helpful. It has changed my entire thinking about sleep, and my children's needs regarding sleep. We're all much happier and well-rested thanks to Dr. Fleiss!",__label__2

In particular, he makes a connection that circumsized boys are poor sleepers (in an attempt to ask parents not to circumsize)based on a study that only showed that infant boys had more difficulty sleeping than girls. He also advocates co-sleeping without any good research to back his advice. I have a two year old with a history of sllep problems, and if I followed Dr. Fleiss' philosophies,I would be tearing my hair out now. He offers no methods to help your child sleep through the night!! I am astounded that others have found this at all helpful.",__label__1

Nowhere is there a list of illustrations or a bibliography and the Appendices are so disjointed as to make them superfluous.Altogether one of the greatest disappointments ever committed to print.NMNB; This review is for the 1985 version of this book and not the more recent edition.

And the songs from the DVD that were not included on the CD,I downloaded them from the internet. I did not want to be without one song. I recommend this DVD/CD to any Fleetwood Mac fan, and play it for potential fans. Five stars is not enough of a rating for this group. I will never be tired of this DVD/CD. It was very exciting and full of energy. This group is still young at heart. And they actually sound even better than they did when they were young.

The documentation that came with the monitor gave an email address for technical support. It's been over a week since I sent the email, and I still haven't heard back from Cornea. The other day was the last straw for me. I had a power outage at my house and the monitor went dead on me. Nothing else at home (linux server, firewall, laptop, etc.) had any problems coming back up, so I'm ruling out any sort of a power spike. I tested the electrical outlet after getting power back to make sure I was getting juice. There was nothing wrong with the outlet, but I wasn't able to get the monitor to power back up.

Once I started fighting back, they started leaving me alone. Reasoning with a bully about how their actions are inappropriate doesn't work. Never has, never will.Never start trouble, never seek it out, but when it comes to you, meet it head on, and it will be driven away. That's reality.And then, there is the even more subtle anti-spanking message hidden in the story. More drivel. The problem with bullies is not that they are spanked at home, but more than likely they are allowed to be horrid little brats who are never punished for anything wrong that they do.This book is not just a joke, it has no concept of the real world, and should be avoided.",__label__1 
300648," A little harsh...: I'm not a huge fan of the Berenstain Bears books, but thought I would give this one a try, since I wanted to talk with my 6 year old about bullying. Be forewarned -- Sister Bear is the one that is ""bullied,"" and she is basically completely beat up by the bully. Brother Bear teaches her how to ""fight back"" by punching, hitting, kicking a large bag of beans in the basement. Furthermore, when Sister and the Bully (also a girl) have to go the principal's office, it comes out that the Bully is physically abused (spanked) at home, and Sister Bear ""realizes"" that the reason the girl hits others is because she is hit by her parents.So please know that you may need to address the issue of physical abuse, and that the book does not advocate a peaceful resolution to the situation.",__label__1

300677," Excellent shower radio!: This Sangean H201 radio is much better than the Sony ""Tap Tunes"" shower radio we replaced with it. First, this Sangean has a good, clear midrange; this is especially important for voice intelligibility in a shower (a noisy environment). Second, the Sangean uses two ""D"" cells, so it will run a long time before batteries need to be replaced, and its use of an even number of batteries (unlike the Sony that uses three ""C"" cells) means that it's better for using rechargeable batteries--they often have to be charged in pairs. Third, the Sangean's ergonomics are quite good; it has a low center of gravity and a large enough base so that it doesn't tip over easily; it has clearly marked buttons rather than a bunch of submenus on an LCD screen--this is especially important in a shower where you probably cannot wear eyeglasses to discern small details.",__label__2

300679," Best ever shower radio!: Bought this to replace a Sony shower radio I've had for years. I was amazed at the difference in quality. The sound is superb, it sounds like you have a component hifi in the bathroom. I use it mostly, but not only, to listen to the news, and the voice quality is amazingly clear. The volume can be set very loud with no distortion. One great little feature that is not described well in the listing is that the FM antenna in the back swings around to become a beautiful and very solid semi-circular handle for the radio, so you can carry it around the house very easily. FM reception is outstanding, AM so-so, but that's inevitable and due to my location.",__label__2 
300680," Well-designed and built, but reception could be better.: This is a large, heavy and well built radio. The only disappointment for me was that the reception was not as good as other reviews seemed to indicate. I was hoping it would pull in some of the local but weaker AM stations like my table-top AM receiver does, but the reception is more like a good pocket radio, so those stations still have a fair amount of background static. The stronger AM stations do have a nice full sound though, so if reception isn't a big concern it's one of the most solidly made radios I've ever seen and an excellent choice for a shower radio.",__label__2

This one is exceptionally well made, with various mounting and carrying options. It functions well as promised in the shower, with easy-to-read, intuitive controls and display. It came in very handy in an unexpected way during a 5-day power outage after a hurricane in New York. Not only was the radio a godsend, but the built-in flashlight, which I initially thought I'd never use, was just what I needed. My only criticism is that the sound is a little heavy on the bass and only the volume, not the tone, can be controlled. I would prefer a sharper sound when listening to news, weather and traffic reports with the shower running.",__label__2

This book haunts you the way an old love affair, a failed marriage, or a missed opportunity lingers in your mind after the second cup of coffee. I read these poems in a parking lot waiting for someone to return, in an airport waiting for a loved one to arrive, and in bed when I couldn't fall asleep. Claudia Emerson was there with me - or actually it felt like she had been there before and I heard her echo, felt her departed presence. The language of the poems felt intentional, concrete, full of meaning and suggestion. The poems tingle, poised between death and renewal, loss and discovery, and that owes something to the language. I haven't lived with them long enough to know how they work, but this is a group of poems worth the time.",__label__2

300718," Great textbook: I used Anton in my linear algebra class a few years back and I have referred to it often since. Anton's approach is to introduce the notation and basic tools, i.e. vector and matrix arithmetic, within the intuitive geometric settings of the Euclidean plane and space. Once the basic concepts of Euclidean vector spaces have been mastered, Anton moves into abstract vector spaces, linear transformations, and eigenvectors. One chapter is spent on complex matrices, and another chapter deals with numerical issues and least-squares applications. The only topic which is noticably missing is the singular value decomposition, but other than that, Anton is a remarkably complete text. The definitions and theorems are clearly presented, along with the motivating intuitions. The exercises at the end of the chapter sections are a nice balance between computational and theoretical problems. Overall I highly recommend Anton as a first linear algebra text.",__label__2

Despite Updike's praise, the flights of lyrical fancy were embarassing. The sex seemed tacked on and the humor fell flat for me (particularly the irritating dialogue between the docs and the cops). The book's main value may be to dispel readers' illusions about the medical field, as well as illusions about the pre-managed care era with its incentives for overutilization of tests, etc. Yes, the author intended to illustrate the monotony of a young physician's life, but when someone can do this AND write an interesting book, I'll give it some more stars.",__label__1

You have to generate the nectar of compassion in your heart."" He's still telling us how.

300819," Psychology Meets Biology: As a non-professional in family therapy, it took me a couple of chapters to fully understand Dr. Resnikoff's model. My bias against using drugs in therapy was also a hurdle I needed to overcome in appreciating Resnikoff's thesis which is that therapists need to be less dogmatic and adopt a kind of post-modern approach to therapy. Rather than dismissing one approach or school of thought for another, the author has developed a multi-dimensional model incorporating ""talk therapy"" and ""drug therapy"" in the treatment of patients. At the end of the day, Resnikoff's inclusivity and open-mindedness won me over where I understood and fully appreciated his complex approach. The ""read"" gets good too when he introduces case studies and examples from his own life to the text. Although not a simple book for a non-professional in psychotherapy, I found the book very rewarding. I find myself using Resnikoff's model as I go through life.",__label__2

Young is a traditionally trained artist/animator so he knows what he is talking about, and he translates 2D physics to Maya very well.The book is concise and well written and the illustrations are plentiful and simple to understand. The best feature of this book is that the enclosed CD contains the generic animation figure ""Generii"" created by Andrew Silke. Generii is used for the exercises instead of the usual 'realistic' (and often extremely poorly designed)character. The well-planned exercises and explanations work for any CGI program, so it is too bad that the title is going to date the book badly--look past the title and get this book if you are interested in learning character animation in CGI.",__label__2

The book really isn't about chess, so don't worry if you aren't all that interested in chess. Chess is just part of the setting. Likewise, if you are familiar with Walla Walla,Whitman College, or Topanga Canyon you'll enjoy the settings, but they're just the backdrop.

The Metamorphasis has much in common with kafka's novel ""The Trial"" in that the main character, a low level white collar worker, wakes up one morning and finds his life has changed. In ""The Trial,"" he wakes up to discover he is under arrest. In ""The Metamorphasis,"" he discovers he has turned into an insect. The reaction of his family is the main thrust of the story and is probably based upon Kafka's own autobiographical insecurities. Another truly surreal story is ""A Country Doctor."" Like in a bad dream, many disturbing events occur and reality changes and becomes distorted. The nightmarish mood Kafka creates is masterful.

Secondly of the two sets they sent me two different lengths of mounting screws which I thought was odd. Also be sure you have a lot of mounting room on either side of the sub box, for my box the plate ends on each of the mounts was a bit too long and would run over the edge of the box, I ended up cutting mine down and using some super advise to glue in the last bar and got it work but if you just want something to bolt on look elsewhere.

When your honing steel can't get your knives sharp anymore it's time for some sharpening. Use this sharpener for 10 - 20 seconds and THEN follow up with your honing steel.

A small amount of ink leaks out over time, and settles on the tip, causing the smudge.The older refills I have for this pen work fine. The ones from China (this one) are absolute trash. I get better writing performance from a cheap free pen such as you might get in a hotel room.

The useful introduction and very extensive notes place the work in a larger context. Bunin really wanted Tolstoy to have died a good death and to be liberated from the wheel of rebirth. The influence of Buddhism on both Bunin and Tolstoy is an intriguing part of the work. However, Tolstoy didn't have a good death, and the reader can feel how much this bothered Bunin. He keeps on coming back to it, trying to make it conform to both Buddhist and Orthodox standards. The work is diffuse and includes many different strands. I would not recommend it as the first book of Bunin's to be read, but it is an interesting look at his feelings toward Tolstoy and death.

300948, Great for Macbook: I know it's silly but like many of the other reviewers say please please make sure this is compatible with your laptop before purchasing. For the MacBook simply looking up the model number through the official website (for my laptop it was for model #MB063LL/A) would provide the stats of which RAM is compatible with the laptop. Super easy to install.. just pop out the battery unscrew 3 screws then replace the RAM.Purchased this to help with my little brother's Macbook (mid 2007 black.) Prior to the upgraded RAM when opening a new tab in a web browser it would crash the computer or take 2 minutes just to open the new tab. Once I installed the ram it quickly opens it up with out any issues. Anyway RAM is probably the cheapest and most user friendly way to upgrade an old computer!,__label__2

300951," For wussy garlic only!!: I actually bought one of these from my local Lechter's store, but as I had such a bad experience with it, I wanted to write a review to protect other hapless consumers.In short: this press is feeble. It can't handle more than a clove, and since it's made cheaply (with a plastic core) it can't generate the force needed to crush even that adequately. The handles bend if you push too hard, and it doesn't fully crush even the one clove it can handle. Mine - after much frustration on my part - finally broke off at the hinge a couple days ago, so now I'm back on the market for a new one.Ironically, the cheap, all-aluminum press my parents have had as long as I can remember is still fully functional.Do yourself a favor: don't buy this unless you plan only to press garlic that's already half mush.",__label__1 
300952," disappointing: I bought this garlic press because it looked sturdy, and although on Amazon it says that the handles are plastic filled, in the store it looked like it was all metal. I had it for a couple months, and was never really very happy with it. The part that squishes doesn't fit all the way into the part that holds the garlic, so hardly any garlic would get crushed. I finally got fed up, and tried putting in two cloves at once, which is when I discovered the handles were plastic. They snapped right off! Do yourself a favor, get a slightly more expensive, all metal garlic press.",__label__1

I followed all of the typical trouble shooting methods and then did an internet search to see if I was a moron. Apparently I'm not and others are experiencing the same issues. I paid over $1,000 for this TV about 4 years ago and now it's a very expensive paper weight. To make matters worse new 32"" LCD tvs can be had for about $350.00 I guess this one will get tossed out because I see that people that have had their set repaired find the black screen to recur down the line.Well Black Friday is coming up.

If you have flourescent lights anywhere near the radio it picks up distortion. I tried the optional FM antenna that Bose sells and it still does not get good reception. I called Bose and the service tech on the phone said that his own Wave radio also has this problem but that the company would not take it back. All they offered was another FM antenna hookup and I will have to go to RAdio Shack and purchase a better antenna. For $500 the radio ought to work.

If you're a huge fan of slash-and-quest, avoid this at all costs.The philosophizing is kept to a minimum, and the (should I say sketchy) ""theology"" or explanation for the House leads one to expect further delineation in later volumes--it doesn't matter, though ... the house simply is, and that's enough.Stoddard's work is kept from 5 stardom only by a certain repetition of incident as the novel progressed; a tighter plotline would be more absorbing.",__label__2

Our society is so dumbed down and we stand back and let them decide what we can watch until there is nothing left but stupid story lines, unrealistic conversation, sugary sweet endings and those horrible laugh tracks to make us all think it's funny, when it really isn't at all.

I love my pets, but all of this goes a little too far for me. the only reason I don't send this book back is because it only cost $8 to begin with and would cost me $3 to send it back. For $5 I'll keep it and try to get past the tree hugging.",__label__1 
301017," good for teaching commands but leave the eastern philosophy out of it: I agree wholeheartedly with the author's approach of non-violent training but the whole communicating with your dog using 'direct knowledge' is an Eastern load of whooey. If you start on p 106 with the definitions of classical conditioning, counter-conditioning and operant conditioning and go to the end of the book. You've got a really good book on training your dog. I found the first 105 pages very difficult to stomach as he refers to various 'studies' to prove his points but never gives a citation so you can read the study yourself. This is then mixed with the various New Age and Yogic philosophies that he expouses. If you don't agree with these views of life you can easily bypass the first 105 pages and have a great dog training book.",__label__1

This book is an average (at best) compilation of training techniques discovered and perfected by other (professional) dog trainers/behaviorists. I've read many, many books on dog training and behavior and this is one not worth purchasing. If you're looking for an interesting read to learn more about how dogs think and why they act the way they do - check out any of Stanley Coren's books (he has many). If you're looking for training techniques - take a class. Honestly, there is nothing better for a dog than to go to puppy classes (with a respectable and knowledgable trainer) where they can be properly socialized and trained. If your dog is having serious behavior issues - consult a professional animal behaviorist. Your veterinarian should be able to refer you to somebody. Good luck!",__label__1

If a couple of guys wrote a book on keeping score on their wives, and encourage their male readers to kick their own wives out of the house if the women are not performing, those authors would be tarred and feathered faster than you can say 'misandry'. Men are no more animals to be trained to do tricks than women are property to be bought and sold. Kicking our partners down does not raise ourselves up; it does the opposite. ""Fixing"" a man?

I am extremely disappointed.The Osrow was much easier to make use. The Simac has a shutter that you pull out when you are ready to extrude. The shutter leaks flour (semolina) and that jams the die and can damage it. I rarely get a full batch of pasta out of the Simac I have to work with it, clear the passage of flour and end up throwing away some dough. With the Osrow, you simply reverse the (more powerful) motor when you are ready to extrude and the pasta comes out perfectly.

I was very careful with my pocket pc (the cost of it was a lot for me) and had even encased it in a metal case to protect it. Two months after purchasing it, it would no longer synch with my computer and so I sent it in to HP. I received a call from them confirming that the port was indeed damaged and that since it was an integral part of the motherboard that the motherboard had to be changed. This apparently was not covered by the warranty and so I would have to pay over $200 for the replacement part.

Mounting screws are included, but look close! I mounted with my own screws thinking there were none in the box, but saw them afterward. There are no instructions on how to mount, for those with no tool skills at all. It is basically screwing a few screws into wood, and you will need to remove the silver part from the base to get at the screw holes. My only complaint is that the sharpener sometimes sharpens slightly off center which can leave a long piece of the wood shaft sharpened right up to the tip along the lead.

So I succumbed and bought the new 2215. I returned it the next day. I tried a 256 MByte camera chip in it under picture viewer and it was so slow it was useless. The screen is poor with low contrast.The transcribe facility in notepad cannot keep cannot keep up with the pen, no better than my old 3630.These things are just pretty toys, cost almost as much as a laptop with the peripherals. I understand from reviews and forums Palm is better.I will try again one day, in a few years when my Psion battery needs changing .....",__label__1 
301088," Review of Fm Transmitter: I found this fm transmitter to be quite good. I was skeptical at first since I already had a more expensive one that worked really good. I needed a second one though that didn't cost as much. I was worried that I would lose a lot of the quality of the higher price one. However this one worked out fairly well. The only drawback is that you have only 8 stations to select from whereas my other one I had the choice of the whole spectrum. However, so far one of the 8 has always worked and came in clear. I would say that it is very good for the price.",__label__2 
301089," Horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible. Didn't work at all.: I read a few good reviews for this product, so I went w/it. Those reviews must've been written by the Monster co or it's employees. When I tried it out, I didn't get ANY sound whatsoever on any of the channels even as I drove through city, country, highway & suburban roads. I tried over & over to find a sound, ANY sound, from my MP3 player on any of the stations. I tried to troubleshoot it the ways they suggested, and I even came up w/a few new ways to troubleshoot it, too! Nothing worked. I moved it around the car, tried plugging it in various different ways, stopped the car altogether, switched mp3 players, switched cars, etc. The product came in one of those completely sealed, tough plastic containers that you have to destroy w/scissors. And, since the return policy only applies to an unopened package, I was screwed right off the bat. I might as well have been trying to use a paper-clip & a rock. Useless. A complete rip-off.",__label__1 
301090," Works somewhat, but I cannot recommend: I figured an FM transmitter like this located inside the vehicle would be able to transmit a strong signal to the antenna. Antenna is located in the back window of my 02 Accord. Perhaps there are products that can do the job well. Perhaps it's the fact I'm trying to play music from my cell phone (Motorola V3m) although the device sounds really quite good using earbud headphones... Perhaps its because radio stations in my area have some stong transmitters at the low end of the FM spectrum. Maybe my stock AM/FM/CD player in the Honda is a poor receiver. I don't find this product working that well for me. Price was reasonable. Easy to use. Operability in my application is poor.",__label__1

I've used it for a variety of events, not just for my kids, and loved, loved, loved it. Recommended it to everyone who asked. Used it mid-May, tried turning it on beginning of June, nothing. Replaced batteries, cleaned it, nothing. Went out to get another one, didn't even hesitate. However, I couldn't find this one, and bought the Jumbo Bubble Machine.

Because I have not delved into many of the features it has, I gave it four stars, but for length of skate/bike/run, pace and time, it is easy to read, far more accurate than I expected and has allowed us to prepare much better for our inline marathons. The price is where it gets really good. I talked to several people who paid much more for their GPS units and found they liked this one as much or better. I am quite sure several people I have loaned this unit, will be purchasing one very soon.",__label__2

So surprised to find an identical replacement at such an awesome price. It turned out nothing was wrong with the wrist unit, but rather the charger.This older model does all the same stuff as the newer, more expensive ones. It is my faithful running companion, allowing me to log thousands of miles that I can download to my computer. Love the maps and all the pace functions. Really easy to use.",__label__2 
301096," A must have for runners!: I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He's a marathoner and has never used any type of watch. I was hoping this wouldn't be too bulky for him. It wasn't. It took a little getting used to, but now he can't go for a run without it. And neither can I! I had done a couple half marathons before, but now since getting the watch (7 months ago) I'm so motivated and training for a full marathon.I've never had a signal drop and the overall pace for me has been very consistent. I've worn it on 2 half marthons this year, and my husband wore it on 3 full marathons and it was very accurate (within .01 of a mile).If you want to get serious about running or just need some motivation to move forward this watch will do it! We LOVE this watch!",__label__2 
301097," Excellent product at a price that can't be beat.: The Forerunner 305 is a great watch for any workout for any activity. I use it for running, biking, inline skating, kayaking, and walking. The GPS is spot on. The distance matches markings on any path and even the odometer on my bike. It's great knowing how far I have paddled on lakes. The accuracy is great. It looks like a large watch, but it actually wears very well and is very light--lighter than my daily watch with a metal watch band. For the money, I don't think you can beat this product.",__label__2 
301098," Great Training Aid: I absolutely love my 305. I have had it for about 2 months, and have had no problems. The HR monitor works great, and the GPS has been spot on. Garmin Training Center software is excellent. The ability to customize and schedule my workouts in advance has made my life much easier. The unit is slightly large and at first moved around on my wrist. I now use a sweat band underneath it; it is very comfortable and doesn't shift. I highly recommend the Garmin 305.",__label__2 
301099," Very pleased with my purchase!: As a new runner, I wanted something simple, but also something that had a lot of features so that I wouldn't have to ""upgrade"" to something else down the line.

301100," Performs very well: I initially purchased this watch a month ago. After charging it as described in the manual, the watch was dead. No amount of charging or button pushes could bring it back to life. I notified Amazon and there was an amazing response. They scheduled UPS to pick up the bad watch and sent me a new watch, just one day later. Very good.You have to keep this watch charged. (I know - sounds obvious) But it's a battery hog. Turn it off completely when not using it and always put on the charger for a couple hours before you need it.If you do that, you'll get some great data from it.",__label__2 
301101, Excellent product-GREAT Price!: The Forerunner 305 has been an excellent addition to my running and fitness routines. The ease of use and excellent software download capabilities makes getting data from the 305 easier than easy.

301102," No Calories indoors??????: One of my favorite methods of cross-training is spin class. Much to my dismay, I have learned that this monitor will NOT calculate calories if the GPS is not running! So if you want to have a calorie reading on any indoor activity, spin, treadmill, eliptical, you are out of luck. What a major disappointment.",__label__1 
301103," Great Tool: This product is the best investment to help my running. It keeps you aware of what your doing at all times. I'm glad that I picked the 305 over the 405, because the size of the numbers are important when trying to read it while running. The only thing that i would change is to have the heart rate readout bigger, way tiny up in the corner of watch, can't read it while running. GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!",__label__2 
301104, Love it...: I've used my new Garmin Forerunner only a few times because the weather hasn't been great and I'm a fair-weather runner. :) So far- I love it.

The price was also great!,__label__2 
301105," Perfect for me!: The 305 replaces my 5 year old 205 and it is so much better. I have used it for 8 weeks steady now with no problems. It is more accurate, quicker to pick up a signal and with the heart rate monitor it is a great tool for training and pacing. I can read the screens with ease and it is comfortable to wear. It is a little tricky to set up the workouts, but all it takes is a little time to read the manual, set up and from then on it is run and have fun. It is worth the money and a bargain from Amazon.com",__label__2 
301106," 305: The Garmin Forerunner 305 works well, a little complex to set up multi sports mode, battery life ok for me but perhaps short for full ironman competitions, downloads to a computer are easy and the Garmin Training Center program easy to use with good and flexible presentation.

301108," So Great I Bought Another One: Even though there is a more current model available, I purchased this one primarily because it is cheaper than the newer one. After talking with more seasoned runners, several said the newer model was larger and the navigation tools were not as easy to use. I purchased this model (again) after giving my last one to my fiancee. It has all the necessities without the price of the newer features that I do not need. PS - I love this size as it is not as large as the newer one.",__label__2 
301109, Great Item: This is the first time I have tried any type of electronic mileage log and I love it. It is great for logging miles ran each outing and totals by week or grand totals. It also gives a instant pace of minutes per mile. I've had no troubles with it so far.,__label__2 
301110," Very helpful for those on the road...: As a frequent traveller and someone interested in specific running goals, (as opposed to ""just going out for a jog"") the Forerunner 305 has been extremely helpful.My wife originally got me the Forerunner 405 BUT it was too small for my wrist. (The 305 has a larger, alternate wrist strap). My wife refers to the 305 as a ""laptop for the wrist"" but it is not heavy or cumbersome - the buttons are clearly marked and easy to use.The various training workouts are helpful and easy to program (pace / distance / time / interval workouts...). I have had no problems with the GPS - just remember to turn the unit on when you are outside and ready to run (to ensure GPS reception). Aural alerts are helpful and there are enough functions to check out that can keep you occupied on long runs.I have not explored all of the training or navigation functions on the 305 but I would venture to say that there are more than the average runner would need to use.",__label__2

I contacted customer service who replied after about a month, asking me to ship it some place in Taiwan! I could have bought a new one and had spare change to register myself for the Mumbai marathon had I done that. Then I was given the run-around to a local Indian office who tacked on a couple of thousand rupees to the already high estimate, citing some circa 1900 laws about Customs, Excise, Taxes, and the like.Get a regular phone with a built-in GPS that does a lot more than this one-trick pony...",__label__1 
301114," Very satisfied with the purchase: I have had some reservations after reading the worst reviews (that it is too big on the wrist, the speed is erratic, it takes too long to get the maps etc.). It is true that it is quite bigger than a watch (but then who expected a small size?), but the size is not prohibitive. The forerunner picked up maps quite quickly (although I must say that I did try it in a small town with not many trees or big buildings). Finally, the speed was always accurate. Overall, I found this watch a great exercise tool outdoors. I cannot vouch for its software as I did not use this function.One thing is that it is clear the price goes down. I paid $150 and now it is $128. As with all electronics, the more you wait the less you pay.",__label__2 
301115," Underperforms: I bought this to use when running home from the train station after my commute. Very disappointed. It took 3-6 minutes after getting off the train each evening to figure out where it was. Not much fun standing on the station waiting for a lazy GPS. Each time I had to take it off my wrist to get any signal, and it always asked me if I had moved 100s of miles since last using it, or whether I was indoors.Once it finally got a signal I would run or walk home. Each time my speed per the GPS would oscillate between 6 and 12 mins/mile every few secs. Holding it in different ways made no difference. My route home is through suburbia with some tree cover but no tall buildings.In the end I gave up on it and got a refund from Amazon.",__label__1

I was fortunate to hold on to the original shipping material.",__label__2 
301117," Best purchase from Garmin yet: I am not your typical runner. I mainly run to maintain my physical fitness requirements with the Air Force. This unit saved me from having to be retested.This unit has the ability to enter in the distance you wish to run and the amount of time you want to run it in. When you press start, a little man appears and below him shows your distance in front of or behind him.One issue I have always had was keeping a steady pace. I, like most others, start off too fast and don't have enough steam at the end. While using this unit I have seen a drastic change in my endurance by keeping my pace steady.This GPS also does so much more than I thought possible, much of which I will never use, but it is good to know that it is there if I do.I HIGHLY recommend this unit to both the trained and un-trained athlete. I don't think you will be disappointed.",__label__2 
301118," Garmin 305: The best yet: I previously owned the Garmin 201 and was relatively pleased with it and its features. The 305 turned out to be even better. It seems to be much more accurate than the 201. On an eight-mile training run, just out and back from my home, the unit was only off by .05 miles, about 250 feet. It was even more accurate than that on other runs. The heart rate monitor has also been more accurate than other monitors I have worn. You definitely want to wet the sensing units of the rubber strap before you run. But I haven't had any large erroneous inputs like I have had on other ""chest"" monitors. The ""take me home"" feature has come in handy on some longer runs in unfamliar cities, and the Training Assistant (I call him ""Larry the Loser"") has been an aid in boosting my pace. The 305 was definitely worth the investment.",__label__2

301121," Outstanding running watch, perfect for serious runners!: My last GPS watch (Timex) didn't work under trees and would lose satellite signal frequently making it basically useless as a GPS. This watch is does not have that problem at all. I do a lot of trail running and frequently run through dense wooded areas and the watch has never lost the satellite signal. It's extremely easy to use and my workouts upload right to the computer so I no longer have to manually log my runs. My only complaint is that the Garmin website does not have a way for you to track shoe mileage on their running log. Luckily I found a great running website called [...] that let's you upload your Garmin Forerunner workouts to their website and DOES track shoe mileage. Bottom-line, could not be happier with this purchase.",__label__2

It shows all the stats of a treadmill in fresh air. This is the perfect device for a multisport athlete. I've purchased the cadence sensor and bike mount for next summerThe only downsides to this item besides the size is the time it takes to load satelites and the heart rate strap was uncomfortable for me with a small frame. I do plan on purchasing the soft heart rate strap in the near future.",__label__2

The manual doesn't tell you how to get out of that, and the garmin web page has information for the older model only.

Then you will be told that although the unit is only 13 months old, the warranty is one year. That's it! Send in the unit with your check for ~$100, and hope for the best. I have had 3 Polar watches over the last 30 years. They all still worked when I upgraded to newer models. I only upgraded for enhanced features.

I'm glad I have it and the price has come down since my purchase. A few negatives I've noticed:- It's still a bit bulky on the wrist (but better than prior models I understand)- I think it reads mileage a bit short. I've run several certified races with it and it seems to time a mile maybe up to 50 ft short- I agree the pace reading is highly erratic as the graph will show you when you upload to the tracking software- I don't think the elevation reading works very well either- I have had a few problems with the physical connection to the dock. It helps to get every last drop of water/sweat off the unit before docking. The tracking software works on my Mac too!Overall I really like this watch.

There is a one year warranty on the watch then you pay 79.00 for a new watch. I think a 200.00 watch should last more than one year. I didn't get much use of the watch because it kept resetting or losing a signal.You really don't want to purchase this watch. Its a lemon. I had a few other friends on the tri team with the same experience. They are choosing to pay the 79.00.

But be prepared to turn the device on to let it start acquiring satellites at least 15 minutes before you want to start running or biking. In my experience, with a clear view of the sky, average time to get a position is about 5 minutes, but it is often more like 15 minutes, even though I start and end all my runs at the same place. Until it has a solid fix, it is unable to track your speed, distance, etc., so much time is wasted standing around waiting to start my runs until the watch finds its position. To me, having to turn the watch on that far in advance is completely unacceptable.",__label__1

So for the past week, I have been unable to save any of my workout information. Customer support told me that the only way to fix it was to clear all my data and start over, so I lost everything I had collected.When the software is working as intended, it is still extremely primitive.

I only wish it had a mode for other workouts besides running and biking so it could track calorie burn from those activities. The Garmin Training Center software is nice, but could use an update. When you change the graph settings for one day, it maintains those for another day even though it is a different type of workout. Also, it would be nice to export all the data to spreadsheet instead of exporting one day at a time. Not really necessary, but a nice-to-have.

Then on my next workout, it showed the time and distance, etc... during the workout, but failed to record any of it to History, so the data couldn't be viewed later. I don't find the features described in the manual to be useful and trying to just use the basic feature of recording workouts seems to be hit or miss based on random problems.

301147," For the serious and patient fan only: For years I searched store shelves in vain looking for a quality book on Peter Gabriel. When I at last looked online, I thought I had found what I needed. However, this biography reads more like a textbook than a warm or interesting biography. The author spliced the book together using available quotes and interviews, and seems to never have talked to Peter himself. And while there are many interesting tidbits, such as the fact that a schoolboy Gabriel once made a hat worn by Keith Richards of the Stones on TV, it really drags. Even I, a serious fan, found myself skipping through many sections. Worth the read? Yes. If you think of yourself as a serious fan. An enjoyable read? Not really. In fact, you may be disappointed in your hero when you learn how distant he was from his wife and family.",__label__1

I found the male lead to be overbearing, the female character a little whiny, and the conclusion made no sense to me (I'll try not to spoil anything, but she spends all this time agonizing over her chosen career, thinking it's not right for her, and solves this dilemma by... continuing on with the same job, that she now miraculously loves?).When I read a romance, though, the main thing I want is to be charmed by the characters. I was not charmed. In fact, the sheer amount of smut, starting on the very first page, was a real turn-off. I was embarrassed by the thought of someone else flipping through the book while I wasn't looking (and the bright pink cover attracted a LOT more attention than I thought it would). So, yes.

Tarantino has a lot of tributes to Bruce Lee such as using the Flight of the Bumblebee song (theme of the Green Hornet), having several of the villians wear Green Hornet masks, and having Uma wear a Bruce Lee type body suit (a la Game of Death) in the grand finale fight sequences.",__label__2

The second problem--she can't act. She's simply a terrible actress. Can movies still be good even with bad acting? Sure. Unfortunately, Kill Bill still sucks for a number of reasons. I know it's an action movie, but even as far as action flicks go, this movie has a crap storyline. I know the special effects are ""supposed to"" suck, but that idea in itself kind of...well, sucks.

It was very difficult to find things about different subjects because the index and the summary didn't give me many choices and information. And the content is only for real dummies.

301217, Fuzzy: My pug loves this bed! She shapes it to her own liking and snuggles right down into it. My cat has recently started sleeping in it when the dog is away and this has created a problem. I am going to order a second bed just to keep the peace. The best part about this is the whole thing is completly washable. Just throw it in the washer and dryer. The only drawback I think it has (and it's not a big one) is that it flattens out where the dog sleeps. But it's really puffy everywhere else.,__label__2 
301218, Single versions: First of all I feel bad for all the people that have bought this disc because of all the single versions.

301219," It's ok...: If you are used to American movies, don't be upset with this one. It's a different kind of movie from a culture very different from the one westerners are used to. A lot of this movie was just watching these women, and seeing their sad lives intermingle. If you want to see a good Iranian film, try The Hidden Half or Leila. They were much more interesting.",__label__1

The were were very old and hard... We only opened one and it broke into pieces. Because it's a food item, you can't return which I think is ridiculous...we couldn't even eat them! I order lots of stuff from Amazon and have had a great experience except for these fruit roll ups. Don't buy food from Amazon!

I'll write positive reviews of other things later!This was the first movie I took my son, then 2, to see. I purposely avoided any movie that could possibly have something too scary or violent (I thought).What completely shocked me was a scene near the end where for a short period of time the rest of the gang believes that Pooh and Piglet have fallen to their deaths down a waterfall! It is only about 10 seconds (longer than it sounds), but plenty of time for the gang to begin MOURNING, and for any kid to believe that they are dead! Huh?I was very disappointed already by then. Most of the movie consisted of flashbacks - which I assume were from previous animations? - which made me feel cheated.I should admit that I am not a Disney fan, but I was ready to enjoy it, really!",__label__1 
301222, This Movie Could Have Been Great!!: I am giving 1 star for the plot and 1 star for some of the funny/witty lines.When good movies go bad:WEAK soundtrack. Boring songs with stupid lyrics.50% of the movie is flash backs to previous films. I would have been fine with the flashbacks if they weren't to movies already made.Not enough time was spent on Piglet (the star) in 'real time' he appeared in flashbacks for 90% of the film.Overall it did have a good plot and message. If you mute all of the tedious Carly Simon songs and have never seen any previous Pooh stories you will like it.,__label__1

I could have worked past that if when I opened the dvd case there was an overwhelming smell that actually made me nauseous!There was some kind of dirt or dust in the case as well.

301234," Strong contender continues BJM's sass: This pleasantly reminds me of Matt Hollywood's BJM album ""Methodrone,"" especially in the opening songs. Later, there's less of an overt homage to the leader's former band's sound, and the crafted music takes more of a Bowie-esque mood and swagger. The vocals could be more forceful (a shared shortcoming with BJM) but the attitude is what counts here. It's a modest but accomplished re-creation of what the band likes to hear, and on these terms it succeeds. The title of the album's evocative, the cover art makes a cheesy magazine shot of an embracing couple look like a fresco from a Pompeii brothel, and the affection for this vaguely late 60s-early 70s sound holds promise for the Crowd's future explorations of this endlessly inspirational period of music and style.",__label__2

Fiske tells the story from the point of view of a German-born government agent who travels to the area incognito to investigate rumors of Klan activity. Fiske tells the story in historical novel form, but the period detail and facts about the murder are thoroughly accurate.

There was so much static it's impossible to enjoy the music. The only way to hinder the static was to hold it in your hands. In my opinion buying this FM transmitter is a gamble.

Choclair knows how to rip the mic on any cut, and he does so with some fresh Canadian beats to back it up. I believe Choclair could rank as one of Canada's best MC's, but a statement like that is too bold to make due to the fact that I haven't heard all of Canada's underground that they have to offer. Either way, this album from Choclair is hip-hop at its best with good featured artists like Saukrates, Guru (Gangstarr), Rahzel (The Roots), Memphis Bleek, and Jully Black. This definitely beats all of that Cash Money/Bad Boy/No Limit garbage that's out today. Big Ups to Choclair on an album well done...now if the Canadian ladies is with it, I'm a hit it.",__label__2

Yes, Ms. Goer seems a little bitter and negative about OBs, but I think you just need to take that with a grain of salt.

Although there are no fist-pumping rock anthems here, there's also no plodding acoustic dirges, no embarrasing experiments and nary a weak track on the whole damn thing. It has a very upbeat feeling and WARM sound to it. Something about the Aiport 5 albums strike me as a bit cold and metallic, and they make me feel like I'm listening to Pollard sing poetry over music he's hearing for the first time.

It lightens up the atmosphere of the reading. She also gives sample meal plans to follow, but the book goes much more beyond the aspects of a diet. There's too much to tell - get a copy and read it - then put it into practice. I recommend also utilizing Gregg Avedon's 'Muscle Chow'. There are tons of recipes to follow.

Big, brawny men who mowed the lawn, fixed the roof, fixed our bicycles, smoked a cigar, drank alcohol, chopped wood for the woodstove during the energy crisis, and valued a good pair of work boots that sat out on our porches because they were usually too dirty to come in the house.

There is a ton of practice questions and hundreds of mini exams on each subject covered on the test. The book also includes 2 full practice COOP as well as 2 full practice HSPT exams. The book however, is ruined by very poor explanations on exam answers and no explanation at all on practice answers. The worst part is the answer key on many of the tests appear on the very same page as the last few quesions, so in other words, it's nearly impossible to take the tests (especially the diagnostics) without seeing the answers.

It can also cause problems for people with sensitive skin. It is hard to find lubes without glycerine.",__label__2

Devil Child Blues is a turn to heavier waters than Ultra Magnetic Glowing Sound, and more mature than the even heavier Psychoblaster and the Misuse of Power.

301298," What on earth was the point to this inane book?!!: The only mystery in this book is where the plot jaunted off to. It started off as a mystery, a pretty good one at that, and then all of a sudden it was about a man who had totally lost his grip on reality. Intelligent writer on one page, human with no reason on next. Who in their right mind would train themselves to live like a homeless person for months, disregarding his own responsibilities, and then being surprised to find his life is not as he left it. The first half of the book had nothing to do with the second half of the book. What message was the author trying to convey with the second half of the story?

Hopefully the quartet can get its act together in the future and find worthwhile collaborators.If you *have* to listen to this, find it used. Cheap. Very very cheap. Don't put more into this than the performers did. It's definitely one that listeners are willing to part with without batting an eye.",__label__1

The relationship between Brenna and Shawn sizzles, no question about it, but I was unimpressed by the occasional vulgarity that seems uncharacteristic for Nora Roberts. Still a good read and some very creative intimate moments. Fell in love with Shawn as easily as his brother!",__label__2

The best aspect of the book was getting to see more of these characters, including some of the minor ones; for example, Breanna's father was included more. The aspect that caused a minus one star effect was the character of Shawn. Somehow, he seemed a little too manipulative in a couple of scenes. However, everything worked out in the end, and I would recommend this book without hesitation to any romance reader.",__label__2

301314," Intelligent music with feeling: I was introduced to Color Theory about six years ago. Since that time, I have kept close tabs on the music of Color Theory. I have always been impressed by the nature of the lyrics. The albums opt to delve into more complex issues than standard pop and do so with eloquent simplicity. The music exudes a great depth of feeling, while still being precise and smartly orchestrated. (I find that frequently, when artists create a deeply meaningful or passionate song, the precision, integrity, and compositional aspects of the music suffer. Color Theory balances a passionate feeling with high musical standards.) And the music is very well composed, produced, and engineered. Color Theory blends strong melodies, full harmonies, sophisticated musical ideas, and solid instrumentation along with pensive and meaningful lyrics to create excellent music.",__label__2

I searched the other reviews to see if anyone felt the same way that I did, but up to this point, I guess I'm the only one.I usually try to listen to tracks before I purchase a cd, but I loved her 1st album and the work she does with Incognito, so I rushed out and purchased it after hearing one of the songs on the radio. That ended up being the ONLY song that I liked. I was SO surprised at this cd.This is more of an r&b type of cd. But she has such a great vocal style when she's varying her range in jazz compositions, that the r&b compositions seemed to suppress her true talent.I'm still a fan of Maysa, but I'm not a fan of this album.",__label__1

Then the DVD... filled with goodies:the music videos to Miss Murder (Directors cut), Love Like Winter, Silver and Cold, and The Leaving Song pt. 2!!! along with the Love Like Winter footage from the ""I Heard A voice"" dvd, and a great interview from the band!

Just because u dont like the cd doesnt mean that is sucks or that the are sell outs. This cd is actually good if you actually listen to what the lyrics.

301322," a nice progression: First of all, anyone might have seen this change coming; it is evident on such songs like Death of Seasons on Sing the Sorrow. Davey has been interested in putting electronic beats or whatnot for some time (if anyone went to their website months and months ago, they had Head Like a Hole on there - extremely industrial). Therefore, one could have seen this coming. It's not bad at all, the album is actually very well-written; though it may take some listens before it catches your attention. True, the album is far more poppy than Sing the Sorrow, but does that matter? Don't be musically smug or an elitist when listening to this album (actually, don't be one at all).Nonetheless, the album was a change for AFI to delve into some experimental waters, and they did not do bad at all.",__label__2

I can't vouch for the ""original masters"" tag most of us nut jobs like to see, but in listening to this CD and my original vinyl, it's the same, or at least so close that I couldn't isolate any real differences.

More of a story than the 'pure' racing film LEMANS - which I highly recommend as well, the movie really gives you the feel of the grands prix world of the mid-late sixties - back when men were men and racing was real - no radios or Eprom chips, just engines, gearboxes and grit.",__label__2

It also includes interviews and insights into the craft from some of todays top animation talent. Big focus on animation fundamentals and how to apply them to your work. Ignoring these fundamentals is probably the biggest mistake new animators who want to break into the business make and the reason for the countless number of demo reels that get a toss in the rejection bin and a form letter.Your choice but if I were trying to learn animation I would want to learn the secrets of the people actually doing it at the highest levels in today's industry.

And that is where it all went terribly wrong. Instead of giving us facts it gives us slander and ridicule. Instead of breaking down the historical inaccuracies of the Holy Books of the three Genisis connected world religions it attempts to give us the impression that believers of Judaism, Christianity and Islam are all idiotic and naive. It was more of a sales pitch for Gnosticism then an accurate portrayal of the majority of believers. I love the idea of the book and I am still a huge fan of The Jesus Mysteries but I was extremely dissappointed. (I also missed the inclusion of footnotes in so many places). Instead of this book read The Bible Unearthed. It gives the information without tearing people apart and calling them names.",__label__1

301383," Riveting Tale of Family Dynamics: I have only read a few of this author's previous works, and was not a loyal fan. This book made me one! I read it in one day and wanted to start all over again once I finished. The family drama is a bit reminiscent of Jane Smiley's ""A Thousand Acres"", but definitely not a knock-off. It was a wonderful exploration of the mother daughter and sibling relationships within a family. Further, Ms. Berg's technique of using photographic imagery at the beginning of most chapters to ""illuminate"" the themes was effective and thought-provoking. The only thread I would have liked to have seen developed is the relationship between Caroline and her daughter, Eva. All we are told was that Eva was grown and moved to California - which in itself is telling, I suppose, but are we left to speculate too much about the meaning of this? I am curious to know what others think.",__label__2

This book seemed to be something the author literally threw together in a day just to turn something in.

Then the sharpener fell off the shelf and onto my desk--not far, but apparently enough to injure its internal organs. After that it sharpened for awhile, but reluctantly.

It was strung up and almost in tune surprisingly. The built in tuner is pretty cool, The sustain is friggin nice. Definitely a great guitar for the price I say. I even have somewhat of a ""thumbprint"" pattern on the wood grain which I really like...Cause it's undeniably my guitar from the looks...Maybe someone would find something like that un-appealing...though i think it gives some good character to it.",__label__2 
301433, don't get this near your pencils!: looking for another sharpener with the helio cutters and figured I'd pick this up for a second unit in the studio.motor shakes the unit so much that it breaks the lead.deep cutters yield points that are way too long when it does sharpen.trying to beat the lack of auto-stop functionality does not work ... it will keep on crudely chewing away.,__label__1

301435," Waste of time!: This sharpener is horrible! it would be quicker to just use a dollar store hand sharpener as it will sharpen better and faster. This does do a great job of breaking the tips as soon as you think that your pencil is almost done. All in all, it takes about 45 minutes to sharpen a box of pencils due to its poor speed. Ive owned it for 6 months and I am completely disappointed X-Acto would put out such a product. I wouldn't even call it a product, its just a piece of plastic that breaks pencils. Stay away from it!",__label__1 
301436," Heavy Duty--Not likely: Agree with some of the other teachers that have reviewed this product. I bought this item after going through several electric sharpeners. I teach high school math, so a sharpener is in high demand. The motor is fantastic--it's outlasted every other sharpener that I've owned. The blades...well, the blades were effective for about 6 months. Now only one side of the pencil gets sharpened, leaving the other edge of the pencil with a thin skin of wood over the graphite. I have found that the more expensive pencils (like Ticonderogas) tend to work better, but most pencils just don't sharpen any more. I now use the X-Acto School Pro as an over-priced paper weight. The 6 dollar hand crank with vaccuum works better than this.",__label__1 
301437," Disappointing: I have one of these in my middle school classroom. It sharpens, but it is noisy, and it does not sharpen very well. Leads are frequently broken, it jams, and the noise will drive you up the wall. Most of my students prefer to use the old time crank sharpener, or the little hand held ones.",__label__1 
301438, Not very good: I am a volunteer at a local elementary school. We offer to sharpen pencils for teachers and have the Hunt Corporation model 167X pencil sharpener (brand name Boston School Pro) to do the job. It doesn't keep up with the job. After a while it overheats and shuts down. It often clogs with graphite and must be disassembled to remove the piece of graphite. Very inconvenient. Unfortunately we haven't found a better pencil sharpener at any price. Does any one know of a better one?,__label__1

301444," Magnificent Music: I am a Civil War buff who had the pleasure of seeing the play in Cincinnati with a fellow history teacher. We both were so entranced by the magnificent score and haunting lyrics that we bought the CD. The mixture of musical styles makes this a CD that will appeal to a cross section of music lovers and students of history alike. We are planning on incorporating this CD into our Civil War unit for 8th grade students. We feel the varied points of view explored in the lyrics and narrations will be an invaluable and memorable way to make the Civil War come alive for our students. On a more personal note, I can not get some of the lyrics ""out of my head."" They haunt me, especially MISSING YOU, FREEDOM'S CHILD, and BROTHER, MY BROTHER. I have told my colleagues, friends, and family about this CD, and encouraged them to buy it. I have also bought several extra copies for gifts. I don't know anyone who could not find something to suit their taste on this CD. Don't pass it by!",__label__2

301446," Our Story in Song: I saw this play at the Alley Theatre in Houston, Texas and enjoyed it immensely. It is not so much a musical as it is an oratorio. Each song tells a story and when you put the songs together, they tell the story of the War Between the States. The story and the songs present images from the north, the south, and those who were enslaved. From the rousing ""By the Sword/Sons of Dixie"" to the finale of ""The Glory"" there is a song type and a kind of music for everyone. From the haunting ballad ""Tell My Father"" (which is based on a letter written by a soldier during the first battle at Manassas) to the eerie ""Five Brothers"" (which is based on a letter written by Abraham Lincloln to a mother who had 5 sons killed in the same battle - and, yes, it is the same letter that was read in the beginning of ""Saving Private Ryan"") there are songs that will stay with you. This is a ""thinking mans"" musical that will leave you with a lot more than what you had when you first put the CD on. Enjoy.",__label__2 
301447," Short life for a Big price: I don't do a lot of highlighting. I use them for marking professional publications and personal books. It is true that the ink does not leak through the page. That's the only good think about this product. What you can't tell by looking at them is that each highlighter has only a very small amount of ink - just as much as you can see in the clear part of the barrel.

Time after time in this book he ripped scripture so far out of context to serve a far reaching point, that I couldn't believe any God-seeking person would take it seriously. I was convinced to read this by a girl I liked and after finishing I told her and everyone else who swallowed this blasphemous message that I would take no part in pushing the church away from reason and truth.

301459," Good for fans of L. M. Montgomery: If you're not a fan of L. M. Montgomery's work, you might not find this book very interesting - for me, most of the interest came from parallels between her own life and that of various characters in her books, and her explanations of things like how she started writing her first book, why she didn't borrow her characters too closely from real life, etc. I'd have liked to read more of her accounts of how she wrote this story or that.The book is mostly about her childhood and various anecdotes and events from it, along with accounts of how she came to be a published writer. It's fairly short; you can read it in less than an hour, so if you want a good, meaty book, this is not for you. But it's nice to read about her from her own point of view - her journals make good reading but this is more of a summary of info she considered interesting or relevant.",__label__2

It is an album full of richly-textured beats, clever instrumentation, and Wayne Coyne's quirky but delicious lyrics. Who is Yoshimi you ask? I have no clue. And who are these Pink Robots that she's battling? No idea. However, once you hear the title track, it suddenly starts to make sense, and all those ridiculous questions go out the window.

This band gets compared to Pink Floyd quite a bit, but that's misleading. Lyrically, they can't touch Floyd, and musicially, they're not the same. However, The Flaming Lips are, I guess for lack of a better term, a space pop band, like ABBA with an almost Floydian vibe. Some of the melodies on this album are positively gorgeous, and the layered, thick production is a deep, poetic pop symphony. I especially love Fight Test, one of the Lips' best songs ever, the title track (both parts), and the really beautiful In the Morning of the Magicians (great title). Sometimes the lyrics are a bit obvious and kind of silly, but I believe these guys are sincere, and the melodies are so beautiful and beguiling you can drown out the sometimes subpar lyrics.

Comparison with William Golding's book, Lord of the Flies leaves The Beach barren. Golding's classic story of the degeneration of civilization among a group of British schoolboys is plausible and frightening. The Beach's attempt to update this theme with present day spoiled rich kids off on holiday is not as successful. To Hodge's credit, he does succeed in capturing the imagery of his setting--I could almost taste the salt of the sea and the see the seediness of the hotel. However, it was not enough to make up for the unimaginative plot development.

In fact Lancaster was so fond of the brilliant script/story that he donated $150,000 out of his pocket to complete the film.

At first I tried just setting it by the house, but it didn't collect much water that way, so you really do need to set it up under a gutter downspout. The shape is great for sitting against the house, as it has the flat area on the back. The only other two things to note is that the hose does tend to fall out of the little notch if you move the barrel around (or bump into it...but this isn't much of an issue really) and that you may need to add a mosquito disc to it, depending on how long the water will sit there.

This book is fascinating and is written very well. I was shocked to learn how primitive medicine was only 225 years ago. Our recent progress under the scientific approach has been astounding.

I found the idea of gender-switching humans to be quite original, at least from my own reading history. :-) The concept of gender, and the ideas we traditionally associate with it, has always fascinated me. One thing I like about this book is that it doesn't shy away from the fact that we DO tend to categorize and compartmentalize people according to sex.It was nice to see that even in their male personas, the people of Tober Cove were very caring and loving toward their children, effectively dispelling the myth that only women can be nurturing.The book also touches on belief systems and how strongly people will hold onto their ideas even when faced with contradictory evidence, but the main character also seems to realize that faith really has a life of its own, a purpose, independent of ""proof"" either for or against.",__label__2

This is very handy for navigating forwards and backwards through web pages, or you can set it to copy and paste or any other key combination through the software provided by Microsoft.However, earlier tonight those 2 buttons I count on for so much stopped working. I rebooted, reinstalled the mouse drivers, did the usual routine. Still no dice.Why not 1 star? I called up Microsoft and they're going to send me a replacement if I fax over a copy of the bottom of the mouse. So at least they're taking care of a customer.

Thoroughly entertaining and a little autobiographical I can assume by the acknowledgements. It is totally a guilty pleasure with some of Milli's explicit dialogue and perverse desires.

Which is the first question I wanted answered. I think he answers it sufficiently. He deals with theories of the atonement and the nature of substitution. He shows the great reach which the cross extends over the all of theology, coloring our understanding of God and the Bible; and the extent of the reach upon our hearts as disciples of Christ.

For these reasons, Von Trapp fans will find the book to be a good addition to their collection. However, I wouldn't call this one a ""page-turner"".

301868," Koontz takes a different path: This is probably my favorite Dean Koontz novel, which is saying a lot since I read almost everything he has ever done.This is definitely a very scary book, but it's more like a psychic mystery suspense novel.The Face, a rich movie star with a son whom he basically ignores, is being stalked by a bizarre, Clive Barker-type, freak serial killer who sends his ""idol"" the most insane ""gifts"" I can imagine (apples filled with human eyes, etc.)I won't give away the ending, but it is a cool twist.I think the son, Fric, a magical, intelligent child, is really the most interesting character. I'm not sure that was Koontz's intention, but for me, Fric was the protagonist. The villain, Corey, is second. The Face himself is, for me, very underdeveloped. Perhaps that was intentional, but I don't think so.",__label__2

The characters are mostly drawn in such raging generalities that you can pretty much recite the lines before they actors say them. I wonder if those casting the film have ever met a college student. They had the varieties right, but the ages were goofy. The obnoxious film student looked 40, the dream girl model looked more like the hero's big sister than his girlfriend. The story, on the other hand is interesting in an art-house kind of way but there is so, so much wrong! Even in the capable hands of Jim Broadbent, the villian of the piece is underdrawn.

301889," One of the Best Dracula Movies: Bram Stoker's DraculaI tried for years to get a copy of this fine movie on DVD and, finally, Amazon has it! The younger Frank Langella does a fine job of making the monster both suave, sophisticated, and seductive while also being very creepy and scary. This particular movie leaves out the portion of the original novel which takes place in Transylvania and starts with the shipwreck in Britain. It is well-paced. I also like how they don't get carried away with the special effects. Dracula does not morph into monstrous creatures nor are there buckets of blood. The creepy effects are created by fine acting, direction, and cinematography.I didn't give this a 5 as I don't believe the definitive Dracula movie has been produced yet. Cross this with the Gary Oldman version minus the graphic sexuality and overwhelming special effects (which extensively portrays the Transylvania portion of the novel and also has a fine actor in the title role) and you'd have the perfect movie.",__label__2

The premises that James Morrow pushes in this book - that God is ultimately responsible for the evil in the world is not new. As Morrow explains in his book, this question has its roots in the Book of Job and has been addressed by history's greatest theologians. What separates Morrow from his predecessors is his cataloguing of history's horrors, perpetrated on both societies and individuals. And this catalog is very disquieting. Ultimately, I disagree with Morrow's ultimate position, but I very much respect his writing and his penetrating attacks upon traditional theological justifications for the existence of evil in a society created by an all-knowing and all-loving God.",__label__2

I called timex and am now on my third watch. The indiglo still works so far, but the interval timer has already begun beeping erratically again.The GPS is hit-or-miss; it often loses the signal under trees or on cloudy days, and the algorithm the watch uses to calculate distance can't handle weak signals.

Then I tried the GE Caulk-It brand caulk and was suprised that it lasted for about a year before becoming slightly mouldy. It also stood up to scrubbing with ajax and a green scrubby abrasive type pad. It comes out of the tube really soft like toothpaste but it is still easy to apply. You will probably still have to add a little more in the corners when it begins to dry since it will shrink a liitle. I usually put a big dab of it in the corners to compensate for the shrinkage there otherwise the moulding area around the tub between the wall and the tub is fine. It last a lot longer then any other brand I used and I will stay with it until something better comes along.

Thankfully they took advantage of this benefit- the DVD is enchanced for widescreen (anamorphic), as are the menus. Big plus.2) This has a stereo PCM track. Meaning, if you buy the DVD, you can make a CD out of the soundtrack w/out needing to source lossy DD 5.1 surround. Greedy record companies charge $25 for the 2-cd audio-only recording, while the concert DVD featuring the exact same audio is only $14. This doesn't happen much anymore. From that end, this is a good deal all around.3) Nice gesture from the band- releasing this concert seperately from Hipomymous (sp?) box set, so a lot of us are not stuck buying the same music we already own.

This music is challenging even by today's standards of rock and jazz.

301973," Let's rename this one to ""Brokeback Arms"" (nod): I suspect the reason some reviewers liked the game so much better with ""subtitles"" instead of ""voices"", may be because they put an embarassingly feminine male character complete with quaint vocal intonations which are unmistakably homosexual in quality. Many typical people who do not respond with interest, enthusiasm and joy at the chortling and sighs of a distinctly non-hetero voice will likely feel very unconfrtable at having their teens and pre-teens absorbed in a game which injects this blatant atypical sexualization into the teen roleplay environment that is Brokeback Arms.

For one... the inside finish isn't near as nice as the Le Crueset pots. The second thing I didn't like was the tiny handle on the lid. Because of the weight of the cast iron lid... if you are trying to pick up the lid it just seemed like a flimsy tiny handle to grab, especially if you have a silicon mit or hot pad over your hand. Whereas, the handle on the Le Creuset is much wider and easier to grab.Maybe if you didn't have anything to compare it to, or didn't want to splurge and buy Le Crueset, maybe this pot would be okay.

He was known for that as well as his comedy, acting, pool playing, the list goes on and on. However, there is no singing on this album. Zip. It's called the Best of Jackie Gleason and there's no Gleason. I was very disappointed when I found that out. When you order it, or even when it's in your hands there is no indication that he doesn't sing in it. I think the seller should put something like ""Instrumental album. Or, orchastra only"" I don't want to listen to an album of 40's era lounge tunes with no vocals when I order something entitled, the best of Jackie Gleason.",__label__1

It was good to finally hear some fresh sublime-ish music coming out of my truck's speakers. I have heard the cd a few times now and each time i think it gets better. And let me be the first to say that yes they do sound a little like sublime but, almost every member of LBDA contributed to sublimes music. So they have a right to sound like that. It is kind of like when AC/DC lost Bon Scott...they got a new lead singer and had great success. LBDA has picked up from where Sublime left off and I hope they have great success. But for now I will settle for this first album cause at least reggae music is back on the loose",__label__2

If you have ever heard of Sublime's ""Robbin' The Hood"", it kinda sounds like that. A bunch of stuff with a few good but incomplete songs thrown in. The replacement singer is the guy who does the artwork on all the Sublime albums. His voice is off key a little sometimes.

First tip that things would not go well was that it insisted that I uninstall Nero, which I, nervously, let it do.Well I've had it about two months now and it is incredibly buggy. I have had to do three repairs to get it to do the basic things like just copying a DVD or CD. It's labelling ""feature"" is junk that also locked up the first time I tried it.

302161," Fresh and fantastic: In the past few years there have been quite a few recordings by alumni of the Magic Band, and lots of other folks covering Beefheart songs, and all of them are worth listening to. But I have found myself wishing there would be something that carries the Beefheart sensibility forward rather than just reworking the past, and this record is it. It's not, as other reviewers have noted, Trout Mask Replica, and that's just as well. This is the logical extension of that music brought into the future--all the angular, fractured elements of that earlier music, but aged in the wine of jazz. Rollo's guitar playing is consistently surprising and interesting, and his compositions are charmingly cockeyed. My one quibble is that the rest of the band, although perfectly talented, play in a more conventional way, and that keeps the thing from taking off as strongly as it might have with more adventurous musicians. Still, it's a terrific CD and very welcome.",__label__2

Nobody will be hurt badly if his advice doesn't yield results, and he is quick with disclaimers to that effect. At the same time, in low-stakes Texas Hold 'Em, there are just so many useful tips that can easily be found on any website, or you figure it out for yourself, as the author claims to have done. One of the thrills of low-stakes gambling is that with a modest pot, you can ""experiment"" with strategies and learn what works best without going home wearing a barrel like in the old cartoons.

I finally decided that I could only read this book as a camp fairy tale--that despite unbelievable odds nothing remotely bad happens to the good guys. Then I guess someone pointed this out to the author, so in a jarring change, the ending takes on a few tinges of reality. The editing allows things like characters supposedly a few hundred miles away popping up in a scene to make a comment. Typos abound. This book feels like a first draft with a cover slapped on it. Read it only if you want a (very) mindless lesbian adventure.",__label__1 
302215," Disgusting and Disappointing: I ordered this DVD expecting to hear and see one of Garrison Keillors good old-fashioned Radio shows. What a horrible disappointment!!! I would return it but the packing slip stated that ""if used, I would not get my money back"". So I will keep it as a reminder to watch more closely what I order in the future. I had also ordered Garrison Keillors 30th anniversary show and that was great! Exactly what I had expected the other DVD to be. Why do some people insist on trying to change Garrisons Radio show? Leave it as it is. It is far more enjoyable with Garrison in charge of what his show is like.",__label__1 
302216," no match for the real mccoy: The key to enjoying this film is to remember that it is not a documentary but a rendering of a fictional last performance of the radio program, but that's hard to remember when Garrison Keillor plays himself--singing, telling stories, and peddling make believe commercials with dead pan seriousness. The live radio variety show that many people enjoyed is one thing; this film loosely based upon it is another. Without that connection this film would never stand on its own. After thirty years the Soderbergs sold the building to wealthy Texans, and thus the show's final act. The two Johnson sisters, Yolanda and Rhonda (played by Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin), reminisce backstage while the show plays live in the background. Country cowboys Dusty and Lefty yuck it up. A woman who is really an angel, a death backstage during the broadcast, and a visit by one of the new investors disrupt the story line. But watching ""GK,"" as he is called in this film, is always a treat.",__label__2

302220," What a mess, a sad ending to a great career.: I watched this movie with my jaw hitting the floor in disbelief. Altman's classics like Nashville had a rambling, ad-libbed quality that enhanced that film and gave great depth to the characters and their performances. Atlman will be remembered for the long leash he held his actors on. Prairie Home Companion has flashes of that technique but any sense of drama or comedy is missing from this rambling mess. The little structure the film contains is introduced by a just awful film noir character played by Kevin Kline. There is also a cheesy ""woman or dame in white"" which ""haunts"" the theatre and sucks away any momentum the stage performers come close to providing. The whole mess ends with childish ""Twilight Zone"" only not as good nor surprising twist. This is film is really nothing more than a great cast having a blast with one of the greatest directors. Unfortunately is pretty much un-watchable for anyone that was not involved.",__label__1

I finally managed to get it by having the seat at a bit of an angle to allow the bar to attach to it. My son didn't mind and otherwise it all works fine.---UPDATE: In the end my son learned how to ride on his own without this gadget. We removed it and put the seat low enough so that he could put his feet down when he felt he was falling. In less than a day he was riding on his own - as easy as that.

Were these images I was seeing a direct threat to me, or were they just for sure? It was hard to tell. That added to the intense gameplay because you're forced to always stay on your toes because you just never know what or when something will attack you. This game reminds me very much of FPS's from the 90's. Games like Doom, Strife and Eradicator. Not sure if the creators were going for a retro feel but if so then they succeeded. I'd say the one flaw with F.E.A.R. is that the maps are too repetetive. Most levels are either abandoned offices or industrial compounds. Spooky yes, but spicing things up a little with the locales wouldn't have hurt. Multiplayer is simple, but a blast! The soundtrack is also very eerie.",__label__2

It definitely deepened my understanding of that important era of American history, which happened to be when I was growing up.The music is mostly great stuff. The film is quite moving and inspiring. As usual with leftists, the film's relatively obvious drawback is the degree to which some of the principals are overly earnest and serious - a little more humor would help.

I put my geartrack up high so this hook would keep the wheelbarrow up and out of the way. You place the edge of the metal on the two hooks so that the wheel portion of the wheelbarrow is highest and facing out from the wall. The two handles act as leverage below the hook and against the wall. I put a little piece of cardboard between each handle and the wall to keep it from making marks. Now that the wheelbarrow has been hanging there for a year the cardboard just stays when I take the wheelbarrow down and put it back up due to the pressure.

But then the book loses stride for about 400 pages until it reaches it's equally hyper-spectacular ending. Boffo!When Carter isn't performing magic, his character is tedious and naive. Other surrounding characters are two-dimensional and introduced in overly coincidental and unrealistic ways.

No sense of intricate structure and layering, no delicacy, nothing to capture the flavor of baroque music because of such heavy pedalling and ponderous rhythms. Of course there are wonderful piano recordings by Richter (RCA), Hewitt (Hyperion), Roberts (Nimbus), Feltsman (Nimbus) and Edwin Fischer (EMI). Compared to any of those, Ashkenazy is embarrassingly outclassed.

302348," Not the game for me.: I am pretty obsessive about game buying. Before I bought Pirates!, I read just about every review I could find, and everyone (generally) seemed to like it. I was surprised, however, when i took this game home and got bored with it pretty rapidly. But this is not a bad game. It is a slow game. There is a lot to do, but none of it was compelling enough for me to really want to do it. The virtual world is huge, you can do a ton of things, but the mini games and the game in general is not that interesting. Because you'll be doing the same task over and over again, it starts to lose its meaning. But i come from the generation whose games are very ADD. If you have a little bit of patience (which I don't), and a bit of imagination, then this game might be the game for you. However, it certainly wasn't the game for me.",__label__2 
302349," Boring: Based on the good reviews here and elsewhere, I purchased this game and was excited to play it. Unfortunately, I do not see what others find so fun about it. I found it extremely slow-moving and repetitive. You sail, fight, trade, dance....over, and over, and over. Boring-boring-boring. There are side quests, but they just do not make up for the overall simplicity and dragginess of the game.",__label__1

302356," So comfortable: I have always enjoyed the high quality of Logitech anything and this is no different. This mouse is so perfectly constructed that I barely realize I am using it. It glides super smooth, it is contoured almost perfectly for my hand and the DPI adjustment buttons don't get in the way at all. I highly recommend this mouse.",__label__2 
302357," Versatile mouse, smooth operation: My new HP computer came with a generic mouse that was so noisy it drove me crazy! Since I've been using Logitech mice for many years, I decided to hunt for something similar to the MX500 which they no longer make. I was leery of the ""Gaming"" mouse, thinking I had to be ""pro"" to use it, but this mouse is just perfect. It has customizable buttons which I love (I do a lot of copying and pasting, very easy with one touch), and it fits my hand easily (even with my stubby fingers!). It is a corded mouse so there are no batteries to worry about, and it has a cool surface with unusual designs. Great mouse!",__label__2 
302358, Second one of these...Keeps dropping connection..POS!!!!: These mice are pieces of crap. I have had two. The first lasted about a year and then started randomly dropping the connection. It is more than annoying to be in the middle of a game and have your mouse suddenly stop working for 5 seconds while is drops the connection and reconnects itself. The second mouse I bought in May and it has already started doing the same thing. I am in contact with Logitech now. They are going to replace it and send another one but I still have to ship it to them and wait for it to be returned.If the return one doesn't work I will be dropping Logitech permanently.,__label__1 
302359, Great Mouse: I am a PhD student and need to do a lot of clicking on hundreds of images every day. That is why I would like to buy a gaming mouse because they provide better accuracy.

Another good thing is that you can customize all the buttons on this mouse to provide you shortcuts for many things.,__label__2 
302360," Decent mouse for the money: This mouse plays great for my games like CS Source and 1942. It is real nice to be able to change the mouse speed in game. Which helps a lot if your playing games like 1942 and you need to go from first person to flying a jet. However the reason I give it a 4 stars is that after playing for a few hours the mouse's design is such that it has a sharp bend right where your right ring finger rests and it can get to be hurting, especially if you play a lot of FPS type games where your holding and moving the mouse constantly.",__label__2 
302361, great: excellent gaming mouse. I got a new mouse because the mouse1 button on my MX500 didn't always respond on the first hit during CS:S.

This mouse responds faster and moves smoother than any previous ones I've used. Would recommend it to anyone.,__label__2

Second, the drivers are not fully XP compatible, which caused some instability for me. Third, the card reader is virtually worthless. It can take an hour just to read DPOF prints.

The camera does not have a data card, like every other digital camera in the world, so you can't increase its memory, and worse, you have to download a program onto your computer to be able to use it. The program interface is surprisingly user unfriendly. Imagine playing Pong without a controller. I took about 15 photos with this camera, all above water during broad daylight. Each photograph's clarity is strikingly similar to an oil spill. I believe this same camera was used to take the famous Loch Ness Monster photo taken earlier in the 20th Century.

She was impressed with the foster mothers in Korea, though she was in an orphanage for one year after her father's death and before her adoption.

Afterwards, the model tries to find the house again. The title should tell you what happens. The setup and glacial pace put one in mind of the first hour (i.e., the bad part) of The Haunted House of Horror, released a few years previous, but unlike that one, this never even attempts to break any rules, preferring to go the classic-thriller route. Problem is, there are few thrills here. Some decent acting, and the atmosphere, but little else. *",__label__1

It contains information on spending wisely, mutual funds, options and insurance in just enough detail to get you started. I would supplement this purchase with ""The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need"" by Andrew Tobias for a great jumpstart on finance.",__label__2

Gin and Miyuki are prosaic and want to take her to the police but sentimnental Hana (abandoned himself as a child) wants to find her family.

Instead of the normal box you see in the picture, the bottle arrived wrapped in a tight tubular gray plastic wrapper. On the bottle itself, they stuck a white paper bar code label that says, ""Centrum Silver, 220-Count Bottle."" Isn't this supposed to be Centrum Performance with 60 tablets? Something is amiss here. Does the company really want people to ingest something when some of the original packaging is missing and an incorrect paper label is placed on the bottle?Update: As I was searching to see if my review has been posted, I noticed some reviewers noted problems with the expiration date. I searched for the expiration date on the bottle and couldn't find it. That mysterious white label I mentioned before is actually glued over the area where the expiration date should be!

So far in one week with very gentle use I have made a small ding from a pot that dropped just and inch off the bottom and two scratches on the top of the sink that I can't explain. These were not copper pots, rather lightweight egg pans. I just purchased the bottom covers for protection, but those are a pain because you must pick them up and clean under them due to food getting stuck. I wish I would have saved up the extra money on the heavier gauge steel models. Now I worry every time I wash dishes.Update: I really don't recommend this at all now.

You have to play all the episodes. If you are looking for a specific episode you must fast forward to find them.

I also love the show ""Life"" (which lasted one season) and I find this much better then ""numbers"" which somehow bored me after a while (too squeaky clean). I've just purchased season 2 via stream on amazon. It sometimes has a little bit of a Macgyver-esque quality to it which I also like, which sometimes doesn't 100% make sense because while I know Jane is very intelligent and clever it doesn't always make sense why he knows random things. I love when they get into the phycology part of it all I enjoy episodes that center around Red John or do not at all, and for once in my life I can watch a show and say that I REALLy like all of the characters on it, the whole ""CBI"" team are wonderful actors and each play their parts perfectly.",__label__2

En mi opinión, The Mentalist (1ra. Temporada) carece de ello. Incluso si uno la considerara dentro del género intermedio de la ""comedia policial"" (en el que se encuentra, por ejemplo, Bones), se la siente insípida y carente de imaginación.Cuando pienso en un mentalista lo asocio de inmediato a un ilusionista, al estilo del personaje de Harlequin, aquella maravillosa película inglesa con Robert Powell, Carmen Duncan, David Hemmings y Broderick Crawford, y siento que The Mentalist se encuentra a ""años luz"" de ella.

One of those strings is even starting to ""unwind"" itself. I'm sort of shocked and a little angry, but this is the one time I actually got what I paid for.

302489," Once again..Melissa and Doug have done it: this is a wonderful sturdy product. I will say I have ONE concern which if you have only older kids it's not a big deal. The one issue is that some of the items like the cucumber and carrot have the rounded ends. This is PERFECTLY shaped for a throat. My little one has put these in her mouth and while I am always watching her sometimes when she is playing with my 6 yr old (who the toy was bought for) and ya just never know! I am so scared she is going to get this in her throat.Again, this is a wonderful toy but maybe they could have made it so that it looked lik it was already cut into.Melissa and Doug is a wonderful company who makes durable and sturdy toys that are built to last.",__label__2

Now it comes with 1 knife and 1 cutting board, so that this toy cannot be shared. I prefer it to have 2 boards and knives so that 2 kids can share it - otherwise fights do ensue.But I do love this toy. My daughter received it for her 2nd birthday and still loves to play with it (she is over 3 now). One problem is that the baby loves it too (17 months) but some of the pieces (carrot) are choking hazards - hence the age warning. We moved the toy to the 3 yr old's bedroom to keep it out of reach of the baby until she is older. I did not notice a strong paint odor upon opening the toy. The toy is of quality construction - I think this toy will last forever.",__label__2

The paint on the vegetables is not uniform (i.e. the bread has streaks of pink and purple on it) and the smell was horrible just out of the box. My daughter pretended to eat it...(this is toy food!) and said ""yucky"" because indeed, there was some kind of awful taste to it probably from the horrible paint. I have to be honest, I love the FisherPrice toy food a lot more than this. She never plays with it, preferring the toys that look more realistic. Melissa & Doug fail.",__label__1

The album is good really good much much better then the debut album we got here in the US. The only one that comes close is their Backstreet Back album that came out internationally. I may be driving my co-workers at work nuts but they actually like the music which says alot. What ever the critics think that only teenage girls like this group, I am so sorry to tell you us adults, and we are not nuts, actually think these guys have talent and we like their music. Enjoy and go out and get Millenium. You will enjoy listening to this CD.",__label__2 
302512," All but one song lacks substance and depth: All the songs on this CD sound so exceptionally corny. The only song I felt was good was ""The Perfect Fan."" All the other tracks are boring and their lyrics make NO SENSE AT ALL. Any concept or meaning of ""I Want It That Way"" seems non-existant. Also, the vocative title ""Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely"" contradicts the lyrics of the 'song' which is calling for somebody to come back to them. Then there's the group's boring and lackadaisical personalities which makes listening to the CD even more unbearable. I've seen them on TV and interviews and they are so boring, obnoxious, and cocky that I automatically change the channel (that is if I don't fall asleep before I can reach for the remote). The only reason I purchased this CD (and later returned it) was because I had heard another pop group's recent album, enjoyed it, and decided to try more of the boy band genre- big mistake.",__label__1

Whoever thought that they would be a one hit wonder has another thing coming. This album has a lot of hit singles. I love it. This is such a personal album. You can tell that they put their hearts and souls into making this album. I am so proud of them. I will continue to support them in all they do. Good luck on the rest of your projects.

302514," Where's the talent?: Wow...in my opinion pop music is a discrace to music in general, but I mean, musically, what can these guys do? They don't write their songs, music is a form of expression and how do you express yourself when it's coming from someone else? I admit, they have alright voices...but that's it. All they can do is get the attention of teenage girls because of their looks, half of them could care less about the music. They play no instruments, they just take turn singing. And it's all about love and girls and relationships, can't they just do something right in a relationship for a change? It's pathetic. And after this whole event with the poor little girl with leukemia in Michigan, they lost the little respect I ever had for them. Don't buy the CD and fuel them to make more stuff(I can't call it music..it's too discraceful) we don't need it. And we also have 2 other groups of talentless guys to deal with..give it up, please",__label__1

302516," Not a good CD at all...: The Backstreet Boys, well, let's just say that they lack talent. Frankly, I personally think that they suck. BSB, and N Sync, and 98*, all of those groups. I mean, I respect THEM I suppose, and I respect all you girls who like them (well, I respect your music TASTE even though I don't know WHY you'd like em in the first place...), but really-- they have no talent whatsoever. All of these groups, especially BSB have no originality. All they do is sing about these stupid love songs that some old guy penned for them. They don't play their own instruments, don't write their own lyrics, and don't choreograph their own dance moves (the fact that they dance is bad enough, not bothering to make them up themself is even worse). If you like this group, yeah, go buy the CD... But I don't know why you would, since it's just like every other male group cd out there-- sugary sweet with sappy love songs filled with fake emotion and passion that they've never experienced before.",__label__1 
302517," Fantastico! Brilliant!Super!Stormin'! Braw!: Music is our common bond and we'll all be lovin' with this one. ""I want it that way"" knocks the competition for six.

302520," Bleeeeeeeeeeeech!: The first time I heard this album I was absolutely stunned. I was paralyzed. This ""music"" is not of this world. It is absolutely unbelievable that anyone could fabricate such total crap. Everybody who gets this album should get money with it instead of paying for this redundant waste of plastic and paper. Recycle these boys and maybe something good will come from it. Dogfood, or something like that. Toiletpaper is also a good idea, but only for girls, cause I do not think guys like to have a Backstreetboy wiping their a***s. Now do you, fellas?

302523," A Surprisingly Good CD: I am an 18 year old, alternative music fan, so I would have never expected to enjoy a cd by the Backstreet Boys. A good friend of mine is a big BSB fan and she got me to listen to this cd after weeks of ragging on her musical tastes. I actually liked listening to it. The exceptional voices of the Boys' and smooth harmonies of the songs are easy to listen to. The lyrics of the songs are usually light and empty, but things don't have to be deep all of the time. I believe that if you're interested in some music that you can sing along with and bounce to carelessly, you should pick up this disc. You can always buy it with the premise of getting it for your 13 year old sister (like I did :)",__label__2

It s%$ked big time!The new CD is more mature and far better-written. Though few of the songs really stand out (like ""Show Me The Meaning Of Being Lonely"" and ""I Want It That Way""), the album is generally easy to listen to.BSB has proven that they have matured and have a more adult groove than 98 Degrees or N'Sync (both of those groups are still in the teeny-bop phase and I doubt they make it out of it). BSB may not survive much longer, as I'm sure that AJ, Nick and Brian will all move on to solo projects. Kevin and the other guy (name? 0k, so I'm not a HUGE fan...I can't even remember all their names) probably don't have voices good enough for a solo, so they'll eventually fade away.In all, this CD isn't bad (despite their being better groups out there) and is worth a listen, just don't expect any classics.",__label__1

302534," BSB Non-Stop Hip Hop and Tear Drops: OK, I admit it, I am 25 years old and after seeing them on MTV, I had to go out and purchase the album. I am really impressed by this album and feel as though they have totally raised the ""musical"" bar on this album. They have definitely matured on this album and every song is incredible....so much so that I keep changing my mind about which song is my fav. They are legit and I am really impressed by the range of music on the album, from sappy to happy to get down and boogie. They could probably release 9 out of the 12 songs on the radio. BSB, if you are reading this, hats off to you for showing people what you are truly capable of doing....in fact, I can't even phathom what your next album will sound like, because this one is SUPERB.

302535," It's a great change that shows how the guys have matured.: Well first I'd like to say that this CD really has a lot of differences from the older ones. This one has a lot more orchestral music in the back round and the guys even wrote some of their own music. Of course, ""The Perfect Fan"" is completely sweet from Brian and the rest of the guys to their mothers. And ""Back to Your Heart"" has got to be my favorite song! I think it's great that Kevin got a chance to write a song, and it turned out really great. I also like how they pretty much evenly distributed the solos, so Kevin and Howie got their fair share, because, of course, AJ, Brian, and Nick, always got the solos before. I didn't mind, because they all have great voices, but it upset me that they did not give the others (Kevin and Howie) and chance to show their full musical talent. Now I think we have a full understanding about why all these men got picked for this group.",__label__2 
302536," Oh Well.....: I don't want to say that this album is COMPLETE garbage, because that would be unfair to the session musicians who played on it and seem to be pretty competent. Also, to those who complain that the BSBs don't play their own instruments, neither did the Temptations, but I wouldn't hold it against THEM. The thing is that after hearing the singles off this album one thing is for certain: used record stores in college towns are going to be inundated with freshmen trying to dump their copies of this CD.",__label__1

You'll love it! Especially the soft songs such as, ""Don't Wanna Lose You Now"". I'd say that their voice have a healing power. Want a faster song? Listen to ""The One"" or the ""It's Gotta Be You"". They'll rock your world! Of course, you should listen to the songs that have already played on the radio (""Larger Than Life"", ""I Want It That Way"", ""Show Me The Meaning of Being Lonely"").

I suggest they get some new ppl to work with, because their up-tempo songs are beginning to all sound the same. Maybe they can even take hints from 'N SYNC, whose new CD 'NO STRINGS ATTACHED' shows true INNOVATION & EXPERIMENTATION. BSB better change their sound or they will be left in the dust!

I would be glad to pay a couple extra dollars if Hunter would first, precut them to my specific size, and second, let people know they will get more than one filter from this box. The price is a bit alarming until you realize it's more than one replacement filter and quite the value when you get six. Overall, I am happy with my Hunter air purifier and the ease of replacement. Yes, yes, I used the new clean filter as a template for cutting the remaining filter media!",__label__2 
302553," Not like the original: I'm not sure that the ""5-star reviewers"" actually ordered this item. When compared to the original filter which came with the unit, it is MUCH thinner and flimsy. Also, there is NO way to get two filters out of this. It is too small. after cutting out one, there is less than 1/2 of the sized needed to make another. Do yourself a favor and order an original carbon pre-filter. I'm tossing this one and looking for the reall thing.",__label__1 
302554," Hunter 30901 Replacement Pre-Filter- Misleading marketing: The marketing material on the packaging, and the website, makes it appear that there are two (2) filters. Not true. I had to cut out my replacement filter from one oversized filter, leaving me only one (1) filter to use on my machine. False advertising. If you don't care about cutting out your filter, then this product is for you. If I could purchase another machine, I would.",__label__1 
302555," The best book on adopting from China ever published!: ""Nothing prepared me for the weight and expanse of the collected voices....The piece reads like gumdrops, each short enough for even a tired single parent to enjoy several in a sitting. I confess I had no idea of the impact of these voices, together for the first time, the sound of these parents finding extraordinary openings in their lives -- hearts cracked open with joy -- through which their individual voices ring so strikingly....The image reflected by the book is large. It's magnificently civilized. It's beautiful. It has permanently changed the way we think about ourselves."" --Rita Guastella, FCC/New England",__label__2

302557," Yoga Tiffany Family Yoga DVD: This is a great dvd for families who want to practice with their kids, whether they are little or bit more grown up. There are two routines - one geared for children under 7 and one geared for older kids. I loved the partner poses - it's basically playing with your kids doing yoga and I was surprised by how focused and strong my kids were (and by the fact, they wanted to do the poses again and again). Yoga is not competitive; it's not about getting ribbons or medals or having to wear uniforms. It's about learning how your body moves, how your breath flows and how to build strength and gain flexibility all while having fun. Because, if it's not fun and you are dong this with your kids, why bother? There have not really been good choices out there for family yoga dvd's so I am so happy that this product is now on the market!!!Family Yoga",__label__2

302561," The truth and nothing but the truth.....: Well...This is the book every journalist should read before he opens his mouth. This is, lets say, a fair book. RFS doesn't say that the PB is the most friendliest breed on earth because som attacks that have happened a typical for the breed. He aswell tells the truth that a PB that is well breed and socialized have a much longer tolerance than any other breed existing today. I found this book very funny and very interesting as I have read almost all books on the subject. This is the best book with nice pictures of some of the best. He points out that owners of PB should be the ones that is open for discussion and the ones with the little extra care for the dogs. To waste a PB by treating it bad its the same thing as destroying the source of courage, loyalty and spirit. I am afraid to say that this breed is more than a dog, it somehow feels like if it is a bit closer to us than we think it is.",__label__2 
302562," Proofreader needed: I am an EE, but not an RF expert. The book may have a lot of useful information, but I can't tell what is correct and what isn't. Even with my limited RF knowledge, I found a huge number of typos, especially in the last couple of chapters, some questionable math, a severe lack of math and theory to back up the ""practical"" hints, and a frustrating inability by the author to express himself clearly. For example, he discusses electrical line length for many pages, but never defines it. He provides many anecdotes about VSWR, but does not provide enough math or theory to tie them all together into a useful picture. It seems to me that the content is much too spotty to be useful to a designer; it might be more helpful to an RF equipment operator with very limited technical and math skills.",__label__1

These 2 books are so great because they help you understand more about yourself (and others) and the strengths and traits of each number. A must in human understanding!!Dr T",__label__2 
302564," I ordered a hardcover book and got soft cover.: When you click on hardcover, it should be that simple. You have it in hardcover or you don't. I buy these for my wife because she likes this series. I prefer to buy on ebay because it is so much easier than Amazon. I do buy from Amazon and am satisfied with the last two purchases, but it is harder to by on you. Now I have to go through the return process which I hate to do, or just keep this small print soft cover and avoid ordering anymore from you. Thanks Gary Weber",__label__1
